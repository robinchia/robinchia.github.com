HDFS File System Shell Guide</p>
<ol>
<li>Overview
The FileSystem (FS) shell is invoked by bin/hadoop fs <args>. All FS shell commands take path URIs as arguments. The URI format is scheme://autority/path. For HDFS the scheme is hdfs, and for the local filesystem the scheme is file. The scheme and authority are optional. If not specified, the default scheme specified in the configuration is used. An HDFS file or directory such as /parent/child can be specified as hdfs://namenodehost/parent/child or simply as /parent/child (given that your configuration is set to point to hdfs://namenodehost). Most of the commands in FS shell behave like corresponding Unix commands. Differences are described with each of the commands. Error information is sent to stderr and the output is sent to stdout.
1.1. cat
Usage: hadoop fs -cat URI [URI …] Copies source paths to stdout. Example: • hadoop fs -cat hdfs://nn1.example.com/file1 hdfs://nn2.example.com/file2 • hadoop fs -cat file:///file3 /user/hadoop/file4 Exit Code: Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.
1.2. chgrp
Usage: hadoop fs -chgrp [-R] GROUP URI [URI …] Change group association of files. With -R, make the change recursively through the directory structure. The user must be the owner of files, or else a super-user. Additional information is in the HDFS Admin Guide: Permissions.
1.3. chmod
Usage: hadoop fs -chmod [-R] <MODE[,MODE]... | OCTALMODE> URI [URI …] Change the permissions of files. With -R, make the change recursively through the directory structure. The user must be the owner of the file, or else a super-user. Additional information is in the HDFS Admin Guide: Permissions.

HDFS File System Shell Guide
1.4. chown
Usage: hadoop fs -chown [-R] [OWNER][:[GROUP]] URI [URI ] Change the owner of files. With -R, make the change recursively through the directory structure. The user must be a super-user. Additional information is in the HDFS Admin Guide: Permissions.
1.5. copyFromLocal
Usage: hadoop fs -copyFromLocal <localsrc> URI Similar to put command, except that the source is restricted to a local file reference.
1.6. copyToLocal
Usage: hadoop fs -copyToLocal [-ignorecrc] [-crc] URI <localdst> Similar to get command, except that the destination is restricted to a local file reference.
1.7. count
Usage: hadoop fs -count [-q] <paths> Count the number of directories, files and bytes under the paths that match the specified file pattern. The output columns are: DIR_COUNT, FILE_COUNT, CONTENT_SIZE FILE_NAME. The output columns with -q are: QUOTA, REMAINING_QUATA, SPACE_QUOTA, REMAINING_SPACE_QUOTA, DIR_COUNT, FILE_COUNT, CONTENT_SIZE, FILE_NAME. Example: • hadoop fs -count hdfs://nn1.example.com/file1 hdfs://nn2.example.com/file2 • hadoop fs -count -q hdfs://nn1.example.com/file1 Exit Code: Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.
1.8. cp

HDFS File System Shell Guide
Usage: hadoop fs -cp URI [URI …] <dest> Copy files from source to destination. This command allows multiple sources as well in which case the destination must be a directory. Example: • hadoop fs -cp /user/hadoop/file1 /user/hadoop/file2 • hadoop fs -cp /user/hadoop/file1 /user/hadoop/file2 /user/hadoop/dir Exit Code: Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.
1.9. du
Usage: hadoop fs -du URI [URI …] Displays aggregate length of files contained in the directory or the length of a file in case its just a file. Example: hadoop fs -du /user/hadoop/dir1 /user/hadoop/file1 hdfs://nn.example.com/user/hadoop/dir1 Exit Code: Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.
1.10. dus
Usage: hadoop fs -dus <args> Displays a summary of file lengths.
1.11. expunge
Usage: hadoop fs -expunge Empty the Trash. Refer to HDFS Architecture for more information on Trash feature.
1.12. get
Usage: hadoop fs -get [-ignorecrc] [-crc] <src> <localdst> Copy files to the local file system. Files that fail the CRC check may be copied with the -ignorecrc option. Files and CRCs may be copied using the -crc option.

HDFS File System Shell Guide
Example: • hadoop fs -get /user/hadoop/file localfile • hadoop fs -get hdfs://nn.example.com/user/hadoop/file localfile Exit Code: Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.
1.13. getmerge
Usage: hadoop fs -getmerge <src> <localdst> [addnl] Takes a source directory and a destination file as input and concatenates files in src into the destination local file. Optionally addnl can be set to enable adding a newline character at the end of each file.
1.14. ls
Usage: hadoop fs -ls <args> For a file returns stat on the file with the following format: permissions number_of_replicas userid groupid filesize modification_date modification_time filename For a directory it returns list of its direct children as in unix.A directory is listed as: permissions userid groupid modification_date modification_time dirname Example: hadoop fs -ls /user/hadoop/file1 Exit Code: Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.
1.15. lsr
Usage: hadoop fs -lsr <args> Recursive version of ls. Similar to Unix ls -R.

HDFS File System Shell Guide
1.16. mkdir
Usage: hadoop fs -mkdir <paths> Takes path uri&#39;s as argument and creates directories. The behavior is much like unix mkdir -p creating parent directories along the path. Example: • hadoop fs -mkdir /user/hadoop/dir1 /user/hadoop/dir2 • hadoop fs -mkdir hdfs://nn1.example.com/user/hadoop/dir hdfs://nn2.example.com/user/hadoop/dir Exit Code: Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.
1.17. moveFromLocal
Usage: dfs -moveFromLocal <localsrc> <dst> Similar to put command, except that the source localsrc is deleted after it&#39;s copied.
1.18. moveToLocal
Usage: hadoop fs -moveToLocal [-crc] <src> <dst> Displays a &quot;Not implemented yet&quot; message.
1.19. mv
Usage: hadoop fs -mv URI [URI …] <dest> Moves files from source to destination. This command allows multiple sources as well in which case the destination needs to be a directory. Moving files across filesystems is not permitted. Example: • hadoop fs -mv /user/hadoop/file1 /user/hadoop/file2 • hadoop fs -mv hdfs://nn.example.com/file1 hdfs://nn.example.com/file2 hdfs://nn.example.com/file3 hdfs://nn.example.com/dir1 Exit Code:

HDFS File System Shell Guide
Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.
1.20. put
Usage: hadoop fs -put <localsrc> ... <dst> Copy single src, or multiple srcs from local file system to the destination filesystem. Also reads input from stdin and writes to destination filesystem. • hadoop fs -put localfile /user/hadoop/hadoopfile • hadoop fs -put localfile1 localfile2 /user/hadoop/hadoopdir • hadoop fs -put localfile hdfs://nn.example.com/hadoop/hadoopfile • hadoop fs -put - hdfs://nn.example.com/hadoop/hadoopfile Reads the input from stdin. Exit Code: Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.
1.21. rm
Usage: hadoop fs -rm [-skipTrash] URI [URI …] Delete files specified as args. Only deletes non empty directory and files. If the -skipTrash option is specified, the trash, if enabled, will be bypassed and the specified file(s) deleted immediately. This can be useful when it is necessary to delete files from an over-quota directory. Refer to rmr for recursive deletes. Example: • hadoop fs -rm hdfs://nn.example.com/file /user/hadoop/emptydir Exit Code: Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.
1.22. rmr
Usage: hadoop fs -rmr [-skipTrash] URI [URI …] Recursive version of delete. If the -skipTrash option is specified, the trash, if enabled, will be bypassed and the specified file(s) deleted immediately. This can be useful when it is necessary to delete files from an over-quota directory.

Map/Reduce Tutorial</p>
<ol>
<li>Purpose
This document comprehensively describes all user-facing facets of the Hadoop Map/Reduce framework and serves as a tutorial.</li>
<li>Pre-requisites
Ensure that Hadoop is installed, configured and is running. More details: • Hadoop Quick Start for first-time users. • Hadoop Cluster Setup for large, distributed clusters.</li>
<li>Overview
Hadoop Map/Reduce is a software framework for easily writing applications which process vast amounts of data (multi-terabyte data-sets) in-parallel on large clusters (thousands of nodes) of commodity hardware in a reliable, fault-tolerant manner. A Map/Reduce job usually splits the input data-set into independent chunks which are processed by the map tasks in a completely parallel manner. The framework sorts the outputs of the maps, which are then input to the reduce tasks. Typically both the input and the output of the job are stored in a file-system. The framework takes care of scheduling tasks, monitoring them and re-executes the failed tasks. Typically the compute nodes and the storage nodes are the same, that is, the Map/Reduce framework and the Hadoop Distributed File System (see HDFS Architecture ) are running on the same set of nodes. This configuration allows the framework to effectively schedule tasks on the nodes where data is already present, resulting in very high aggregate bandwidth across the cluster. The Map/Reduce framework consists of a single master JobTracker and one slave TaskTracker per cluster-node. The master is responsible for scheduling the jobs&#39; component tasks on the slaves, monitoring them and re-executing the failed tasks. The slaves execute the tasks as directed by the master. Minimally, applications specify the input/output locations and supply map and reduce functions via implementations of appropriate interfaces and/or abstract-classes. These, and other job parameters, comprise the job configuration. The Hadoop job client then submits the job (jar/executable etc.) and configuration to the JobTracker which then assumes the responsibility of distributing the software/configuration to the slaves, scheduling tasks and monitoring them, providing status and diagnostic information to the job-client.

Map/Reduce Tutorial
Although the Hadoop framework is implemented in JavaTM, Map/Reduce applications need not be written in Java. • Hadoop Streaming is a utility which allows users to create and run jobs with any executables (e.g. shell utilities) as the mapper and/or the reducer. • Hadoop Pipes is a SWIG- compatible C++ API to implement Map/Reduce applications (non JNITM based).</li>
<li>Inputs and Outputs
The Map/Reduce framework operates exclusively on <key, value> pairs, that is, the framework views the input to the job as a set of <key, value> pairs and produces a set of <key, value> pairs as the output of the job, conceivably of different types. The key and value classes have to be serializable by the framework and hence need to implement the Writable interface. Additionally, the key classes have to implement the WritableComparable interface to facilitate sorting by the framework. Input and Output types of a Map/Reduce job: (input) <k1, v1> -&gt; map -&gt; <k2, v2> -&gt; combine -&gt; <k2, v2> -&gt; reduce -&gt; <k3, v3> (output)</li>
<li>Example: WordCount v1.0
Before we jump into the details, lets walk through an example Map/Reduce application to get a flavour for how they work. WordCount is a simple application that counts the number of occurences of each word in a given input set. This works with a local-standalone, pseudo-distributed or fully-distributed Hadoop installation(see Hadoop Quick Start).

5.2. Usage
Assuming HADOOP_HOME is the root of the installation and HADOOP_VERSION is the Hadoop version installed, compile WordCount.java and create a jar: $ mkdir wordcount_classes $ javac -classpath ${HADOOP_HOME}/hadoop-${HADOOP_VERSION}-core.jar -d wordcount_classes WordCount.java $ jar -cvf /usr/joe/wordcount.jar -C wordcount_classes/ . Assuming that: • /usr/joe/wordcount/input - input directory in HDFS

•
/usr/joe/wordcount/output - output directory in HDFS
Sample text-files as input: $ bin/hadoop dfs -ls /usr/joe/wordcount/input/ /usr/joe/wordcount/input/file01 /usr/joe/wordcount/input/file02 $ bin/hadoop dfs -cat /usr/joe/wordcount/input/file01 Hello World Bye World $ bin/hadoop dfs -cat /usr/joe/wordcount/input/file02 Hello Hadoop Goodbye Hadoop Run the application: $ bin/hadoop jar /usr/joe/wordcount.jar org.myorg.WordCount /usr/joe/wordcount/input /usr/joe/wordcount/output Output: $ bin/hadoop dfs -cat /usr/joe/wordcount/output/part-00000 Bye 1 Goodbye 1 Hadoop 2 Hello 2 World 2 Applications can specify a comma separated list of paths which would be present in the current working directory of the task using the option -files. The -libjars option allows applications to add jars to the classpaths of the maps and reduces. The -archives allows them to pass archives as arguments that are unzipped/unjarred and a link with name of the jar/zip are created in the current working directory of tasks. More details about the command line options are available at Hadoop Command Guide. Running wordcount example with -libjars and -files: hadoop jar hadoop-examples.jar wordcount -files cachefile.txt -libjars mylib.jar input output
5.3. Walk-through
The WordCount application is quite straight-forward. The Mapper implementation (lines 14-26), via the map method (lines 18-25), processes one line at a time, as provided by the specified TextInputFormat (line 49). It then splits the line into tokens separated by whitespaces, via the StringTokenizer, and emits a

Map/Reduce Tutorial
key-value pair of &lt; <word>, 1&gt;. For the given sample input the first map emits: &lt; Hello, 1&gt; &lt; World, 1&gt; &lt; Bye, 1&gt; &lt; World, 1&gt; The second map emits: &lt; Hello, 1&gt; &lt; Hadoop, 1&gt; &lt; Goodbye, 1&gt; &lt; Hadoop, 1&gt; We&#39;ll learn more about the number of maps spawned for a given job, and how to control them in a fine-grained manner, a bit later in the tutorial. WordCount also specifies a combiner (line 46). Hence, the output of each map is passed through the local combiner (which is same as the Reducer as per the job configuration) for local aggregation, after being sorted on the keys. The output of the first map: &lt; Bye, 1&gt; &lt; Hello, 1&gt; &lt; World, 2&gt; The output of the second map: &lt; Goodbye, 1&gt; &lt; Hadoop, 2&gt; &lt; Hello, 1&gt; The Reducer implementation (lines 28-36), via the reduce method (lines 29-35) just sums up the values, which are the occurence counts for each key (i.e. words in this example). Thus the output of the job is: &lt; Bye, 1&gt; &lt; Goodbye, 1&gt; &lt; Hadoop, 2&gt; &lt; Hello, 2&gt; &lt; World, 2&gt; The run method specifies various facets of the job, such as the input/output paths (passed via the command line), key/value types, input/output formats etc., in the JobConf. It then calls the JobClient.runJob (line 55) to submit the and monitor its progress.

Map/Reduce Tutorial
We&#39;ll learn more about JobConf, JobClient, Tool and other interfaces and classes a bit later in the tutorial.</li>
<li>Map/Reduce - User Interfaces
This section provides a reasonable amount of detail on every user-facing aspect of the Map/Reduce framwork. This should help users implement, configure and tune their jobs in a fine-grained manner. However, please note that the javadoc for each class/interface remains the most comprehensive documentation available; this is only meant to be a tutorial. Let us first take the Mapper and Reducer interfaces. Applications typically implement them to provide the map and reduce methods. We will then discuss other core interfaces including JobConf, JobClient, Partitioner, OutputCollector, Reporter, InputFormat, OutputFormat, OutputCommitter and others. Finally, we will wrap up by discussing some useful features of the framework such as the DistributedCache, IsolationRunner etc.
6.1. Payload
Applications typically implement the Mapper and Reducer interfaces to provide the map and reduce methods. These form the core of the job. 6.1.1. Mapper Mapper maps input key/value pairs to a set of intermediate key/value pairs. Maps are the individual tasks that transform input records into intermediate records. The transformed intermediate records do not need to be of the same type as the input records. A given input pair may map to zero or many output pairs. The Hadoop Map/Reduce framework spawns one map task for each InputSplit generated by the InputFormat for the job. Overall, Mapper implementations are passed the JobConf for the job via the JobConfigurable.configure(JobConf) method and override it to initialize themselves. The framework then calls map(WritableComparable, Writable, OutputCollector, Reporter) for each key/value pair in the InputSplit for that task. Applications can then override the Closeable.close() method to perform any required cleanup. Output pairs do not need to be of the same types as input pairs. A given input pair may map

Map/Reduce Tutorial
to zero or many output pairs. Output pairs are collected with calls to OutputCollector.collect(WritableComparable,Writable). Applications can use the Reporter to report progress, set application-level status messages and update Counters, or just indicate that they are alive. All intermediate values associated with a given output key are subsequently grouped by the framework, and passed to the Reducer(s) to determine the final output. Users can control the grouping by specifying a Comparator via JobConf.setOutputKeyComparatorClass(Class). The Mapper outputs are sorted and then partitioned per Reducer. The total number of partitions is the same as the number of reduce tasks for the job. Users can control which keys (and hence records) go to which Reducer by implementing a custom Partitioner. Users can optionally specify a combiner, via JobConf.setCombinerClass(Class), to perform local aggregation of the intermediate outputs, which helps to cut down the amount of data transferred from the Mapper to the Reducer. The intermediate, sorted outputs are always stored in a simple (key-len, key, value-len, value) format. Applications can control if, and how, the intermediate outputs are to be compressed and the CompressionCodec to be used via the JobConf.
6.1.1.1. How Many Maps?
The number of maps is usually driven by the total size of the inputs, that is, the total number of blocks of the input files. The right level of parallelism for maps seems to be around 10-100 maps per-node, although it has been set up to 300 maps for very cpu-light map tasks. Task setup takes awhile, so it is best if the maps take at least a minute to execute. Thus, if you expect 10TB of input data and have a blocksize of 128MB, you&#39;ll end up with 82,000 maps, unless setNumMapTasks(int) (which only provides a hint to the framework) is used to set it even higher. 6.1.2. Reducer Reducer reduces a set of intermediate values which share a key to a smaller set of values. The number of reduces for the job is set by the user via JobConf.setNumReduceTasks(int). Overall, Reducer implementations are passed the JobConf for the job via the JobConfigurable.configure(JobConf) method and can override it to initialize themselves. The

Map/Reduce Tutorial
framework then calls reduce(WritableComparable, Iterator, OutputCollector, Reporter) method for each <key, (list of values)> pair in the grouped inputs. Applications can then override the Closeable.close() method to perform any required cleanup. Reducer has 3 primary phases: shuffle, sort and reduce.
6.1.2.1. Shuffle
Input to the Reducer is the sorted output of the mappers. In this phase the framework fetches the relevant partition of the output of all the mappers, via HTTP.
6.1.2.2. Sort
The framework groups Reducer inputs by keys (since different mappers may have output the same key) in this stage. The shuffle and sort phases occur simultaneously; while map-outputs are being fetched they are merged.
Secondary Sort
If equivalence rules for grouping the intermediate keys are required to be different from those for grouping keys before reduction, then one may specify a Comparator via JobConf.setOutputValueGroupingComparator(Class). Since JobConf.setOutputKeyComparatorClass(Class) can be used to control how intermediate keys are grouped, these can be used in conjunction to simulate secondary sort on values.
6.1.2.3. Reduce
In this phase the reduce(WritableComparable, Iterator, OutputCollector, Reporter) method is called for each <key, (list of values)> pair in the grouped inputs. The output of the reduce task is typically written to the FileSystem via OutputCollector.collect(WritableComparable, Writable). Applications can use the Reporter to report progress, set application-level status messages and update Counters, or just indicate that they are alive. The output of the Reducer is not sorted.
6.1.2.4. How Many Reduces?
The right number of reduces seems to be 0.95 or 1.75 multiplied by (<no. of nodes> /<em> mapred.tasktracker.reduce.tasks.maximum).
Page 11
Copyright © 2008 The Apache Software Foundation. All rights reserved.
Map/Reduce Tutorial
With 0.95 all of the reduces can launch immediately and start transfering map outputs as the maps finish. With 1.75 the faster nodes will finish their first round of reduces and launch a second wave of reduces doing a much better job of load balancing. Increasing the number of reduces increases the framework overhead, but increases load balancing and lowers the cost of failures. The scaling factors above are slightly less than whole numbers to reserve a few reduce slots in the framework for speculative-tasks and failed tasks.
6.1.2.5. Reducer NONE
It is legal to set the number of reduce-tasks to zero if no reduction is desired. In this case the outputs of the map-tasks go directly to the FileSystem, into the output path set by setOutputPath(Path). The framework does not sort the map-outputs before writing them out to the FileSystem. 6.1.3. Partitioner Partitioner partitions the key space. Partitioner controls the partitioning of the keys of the intermediate map-outputs. The key (or a subset of the key) is used to derive the partition, typically by a hash function. The total number of partitions is the same as the number of reduce tasks for the job. Hence this controls which of the m reduce tasks the intermediate key (and hence the record) is sent to for reduction. HashPartitioner is the default Partitioner. 6.1.4. Reporter Reporter is a facility for Map/Reduce applications to report progress, set application-level status messages and update Counters. Mapper and Reducer implementations can use the Reporter to report progress or just indicate that they are alive. In scenarios where the application takes a significant amount of time to process individual key/value pairs, this is crucial since the framework might assume that the task has timed-out and kill that task. Another way to avoid this is to set the configuration parameter mapred.task.timeout to a high-enough value (or even set it to zero for no time-outs). Applications can also update Counters using the Reporter.

Map/Reduce Tutorial
6.1.5. OutputCollector OutputCollector is a generalization of the facility provided by the Map/Reduce framework to collect data output by the Mapper or the Reducer (either the intermediate outputs or the output of the job). Hadoop Map/Reduce comes bundled with a library of generally useful mappers, reducers, and partitioners.
6.2. Job Configuration
JobConf represents a Map/Reduce job configuration. JobConf is the primary interface for a user to describe a Map/Reduce job to the Hadoop framework for execution. The framework tries to faithfully execute the job as described by JobConf, however: • f Some configuration parameters may have been marked as final by administrators and hence cannot be altered. • While some job parameters are straight-forward to set (e.g. setNumReduceTasks(int)), other parameters interact subtly with the rest of the framework and/or job configuration and are more complex to set (e.g. setNumMapTasks(int)). JobConf is typically used to specify the Mapper, combiner (if any), Partitioner, Reducer, InputFormat, OutputFormat and OutputCommitter implementations. JobConf also indicates the set of input files (setInputPaths(JobConf, Path...) /addInputPath(JobConf, Path)) and (setInputPaths(JobConf, String) /addInputPaths(JobConf, String)) and where the output files should be written (setOutputPath(Path)). Optionally, JobConf is used to specify other advanced facets of the job such as the Comparator to be used, files to be put in the DistributedCache, whether intermediate and/or job outputs are to be compressed (and how), debugging via user-provided scripts (setMapDebugScript(String)/setReduceDebugScript(String)) , whether job tasks can be executed in a speculative manner (setMapSpeculativeExecution(boolean))/(setReduceSpeculativeExecution(boolean)) , maximum number of attempts per task (setMaxMapAttempts(int)/setMaxReduceAttempts(int)) , percentage of tasks failure which can be tolerated by the job (setMaxMapTaskFailuresPercent(int)/setMaxReduceTaskFailuresPercent(int)) etc. Of course, users can use set(String, String)/get(String, String) to set/get arbitrary parameters needed by applications. However, use the DistributedCache for large amounts of

Map/Reduce Tutorial
(read-only) data.
6.3. Task Execution &amp; Environment
The TaskTracker executes the Mapper/ Reducer task as a child process in a separate jvm. The child-task inherits the environment of the parent TaskTracker. The user can specify additional options to the child-jvm via the mapred.child.java.opts configuration parameter in the JobConf such as non-standard paths for the run-time linker to search shared libraries via -Djava.library.path=&lt;&gt; etc. If the mapred.child.java.opts contains the symbol @taskid@ it is interpolated with value of taskid of the map/reduce task. Here is an example with multiple arguments and substitutions, showing jvm GC logging, and start of a passwordless JVM JMX agent so that it can connect with jconsole and the likes to watch child memory, threads and get thread dumps. It also sets the maximum heap-size of the child jvm to 512MB and adds an additional path to the java.library.path of the child-jvm. <property> <name>mapred.child.java.opts</name> <value> -Xmx512M -Djava.library.path=/home/mycompany/lib -verbose:gc -Xloggc:/tmp/@taskid@.gc -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false </value> </property> 6.3.1. Memory management Users/admins can also specify the maximum virtual memory of the launched child-task, and any sub-process it launches recursively, using mapred.child.ulimit. Note that the value set here is a per process limit. The value for mapred.child.ulimit should be specified in kilo bytes (KB). And also the value must be greater than or equal to the -Xmx passed to JavaVM, else the VM might not start. Note: mapred.child.java.opts are used only for configuring the launched child tasks from task tracker. Configuring the memory options for daemons is documented in cluster_setup.html The memory available to some parts of the framework is also configurable. In map and

Map/Reduce Tutorial
reduce tasks, performance may be influenced by adjusting parameters influencing the concurrency of operations and the frequency with which data will hit disk. Monitoring the filesystem counters for a job- particularly relative to byte counts from the map and into the reduce- is invaluable to the tuning of these parameters. 6.3.2. Map Parameters A record emitted from a map will be serialized into a buffer and metadata will be stored into accounting buffers. As described in the following options, when either the serialization buffer or the metadata exceed a threshold, the contents of the buffers will be sorted and written to disk in the background while the map continues to output records. If either buffer fills completely while the spill is in progress, the map thread will block. When the map is finished, any remaining records are written to disk and all on-disk segments are merged into a single file. Minimizing the number of spills to disk can decrease map time, but a larger buffer also decreases the memory available to the mapper.
Name io.sort.mb int Type Description The cumulative size of the serialization and accounting buffers storing records emitted from the map, in megabytes. The ratio of serialization to accounting space can be adjusted. Each serialized record requires 16 bytes of accounting information in addition to its serialized size to effect the sort. This percentage of space allocated from io.sort.mb affects the probability of a spill to disk being caused by either exhaustion of the serialization buffer or the accounting space. Clearly, for a map outputting small records, a higher value than the default will likely decrease the number of spills to disk. This is the threshold for the accounting and serialization buffers. When this percentage of either buffer has filled, their

float
io.sort.spill.percent

Map/Reduce Tutorial
contents will be spilled to disk in the background. Let io.sort.record.percent be r, io.sort.mb be x, and this value be q. The maximum number of records collected before the collection thread will spill is r /</em> x /<em> q /</em> 2^16. Note that a higher value may decrease the number of- or even eliminate- merges, but will also increase the probability of the map task getting blocked. The lowest average map times are usually obtained by accurately estimating the size of the map output and preventing multiple spills.
Other notes • If either spill threshold is exceeded while a spill is in progress, collection will continue until the spill is finished. For example, if io.sort.buffer.spill.percent is set to 0.33, and the remainder of the buffer is filled while the spill runs, the next spill will include all the collected records, or 0.66 of the buffer, and will not generate additional spills. In other words, the thresholds are defining triggers, not blocking. • A record larger than the serialization buffer will first trigger a spill, then be spilled to a separate file. It is undefined whether or not this record will first pass through the combiner. 6.3.3. Shuffle/Reduce Parameters As described previously, each reduce fetches the output assigned to it by the Partitioner via HTTP into memory and periodically merges these outputs to disk. If intermediate compression of map outputs is turned on, each output is decompressed into memory. The following options affect the frequency of these merges to disk prior to the reduce and the memory allocated to map output during the reduce.
Name io.sort.factor int Type Description Specifies the number of segments on disk to be merged at the same time. It limits the number of open files and compression codecs during the merge. If the number of files

Map/Reduce Tutorial
exceeds this limit, the merge will proceed in several passes. Though this limit also applies to the map, most jobs should be configured so that hitting this limit is unlikely there. mapred.inmem.merge.threshold int The number of sorted map outputs fetched into memory before being merged to disk. Like the spill thresholds in the preceding note, this is not defining a unit of partition, but a trigger. In practice, this is usually set very high (1000) or disabled (0), since merging in-memory segments is often less expensive than merging from disk (see notes following this table). This threshold influences only the frequency of in-memory merges during the shuffle. The memory threshold for fetched map outputs before an in-memory merge is started, expressed as a percentage of memory allocated to storing map outputs in memory. Since map outputs that can&#39;t fit in memory can be stalled, setting this high may decrease parallelism between the fetch and merge. Conversely, values as high as 1.0 have been effective for reduces whose input can fit entirely in memory. This parameter influences only the frequency of in-memory merges during the shuffle. The percentage of memoryrelative to the maximum heapsize as typically specified in mapred.child.java.optsthat can be allocated to storing
mapred.job.shuffle.merge.percentfloat
mapred.job.shuffle.input.buffer.percent float

Map/Reduce Tutorial
map outputs during the shuffle. Though some memory should be set aside for the framework, in general it is advantageous to set this high enough to store large and numerous map outputs. mapred.job.reduce.input.buffer.percent float The percentage of memory relative to the maximum heapsize in which map outputs may be retained during the reduce. When the reduce begins, map outputs will be merged to disk until those that remain are under the resource limit this defines. By default, all map outputs are merged to disk before the reduce begins to maximize the memory available to the reduce. For less memory-intensive reduces, this should be increased to avoid trips to disk.
Other notes • If a map output is larger than 25 percent of the memory allocated to copying map outputs, it will be written directly to disk without first staging through memory. • When running with a combiner, the reasoning about high merge thresholds and large buffers may not hold. For merges started before all map outputs have been fetched, the combiner is run while spilling to disk. In some cases, one can obtain better reduce times by spending resources combining map outputs- making disk spills small and parallelizing spilling and fetching- rather than aggressively increasing buffer sizes. • When merging in-memory map outputs to disk to begin the reduce, if an intermediate merge is necessary because there are segments to spill and at least io.sort.factor segments already on disk, the in-memory map outputs will be part of the intermediate merge. 6.3.4. Directory Structure The task tracker has local directory, ${mapred.local.dir}/taskTracker/ to create localized cache and localized job. It can define multiple local directories (spanning multiple disks) and then each filename is assigned to a semi-random local directory. When the job starts, task tracker creates a localized job directory relative to the local directory specified in
Page 18

Map/Reduce Tutorial
the configuration. Thus the task tracker directory structure looks the following: • ${mapred.local.dir}/taskTracker/archive/ : The distributed cache. This directory holds the localized distributed cache. Thus localized distributed cache is shared among all the tasks and jobs • ${mapred.local.dir}/taskTracker/jobcache/$jobid/ : The localized job directory • ${mapred.local.dir}/taskTracker/jobcache/$jobid/work/ : The job-specific shared directory. The tasks can use this space as scratch space and share files among them. This directory is exposed to the users through the configuration property job.local.dir. The directory can accessed through api JobConf.getJobLocalDir(). It is available as System property also. So, users (streaming etc.) can call System.getProperty(&quot;job.local.dir&quot;) to access the directory. • ${mapred.local.dir}/taskTracker/jobcache/$jobid/jars/ : The jars directory, which has the job jar file and expanded jar. The job.jar is the application&#39;s jar file that is automatically distributed to each machine. It is expanded in jars directory before the tasks for the job start. The job.jar location is accessible to the application through the api JobConf.getJar() . To access the unjarred directory, JobConf.getJar().getParent() can be called. • ${mapred.local.dir}/taskTracker/jobcache/$jobid/job.xml : The job.xml file, the generic job configuration, localized for the job. • ${mapred.local.dir}/taskTracker/jobcache/$jobid/$taskid : The task directory for each task attempt. Each task directory again has the following structure : • ${mapred.local.dir}/taskTracker/jobcache/$jobid/$taskid/job.xml : A job.xml file, task localized job configuration, Task localization means that properties have been set that are specific to this particular task within the job. The properties localized for each task are described below. • ${mapred.local.dir}/taskTracker/jobcache/$jobid/$taskid/output : A directory for intermediate output files. This contains the temporary map reduce data generated by the framework such as map output files etc. • ${mapred.local.dir}/taskTracker/jobcache/$jobid/$taskid/work : The curernt working directory of the task. With jvm reuse enabled for tasks, this directory will be the directory on which the jvm has started • ${mapred.local.dir}/taskTracker/jobcache/$jobid/$taskid/work/tmp : The temporary directory for the task. (User can specify the property mapred.child.tmp to set the value of temporary directory for map and reduce tasks. This defaults to ./tmp. If the value is not an absolute path, it is prepended with task&#39;s working directory. Otherwise, it is directly assigned. The directory will be created if it doesn&#39;t exist. Then, the child java tasks are executed

Map/Reduce Tutorial
with option -Djava.io.tmpdir=&#39;the absolute path of the tmp dir&#39;. Anp pipes and streaming are set with environment variable, TMPDIR=&#39;the absolute path of the tmp dir&#39;). This directory is created, if mapred.child.tmp has the value ./tmp
6.3.5. Task JVM Reuse Jobs can enable task JVMs to be reused by specifying the job configuration mapred.job.reuse.jvm.num.tasks. If the value is 1 (the default), then JVMs are not reused (i.e. 1 task per JVM). If it is -1, there is no limit to the number of tasks a JVM can run (of the same job). One can also specify some value greater than 1 using the api JobConf.setNumTasksToExecutePerJvm(int) The following properties are localized in the job configuration for each task&#39;s execution:
Name mapred.job.id mapred.jar job.local.dir mapred.tip.id mapred.task.id mapred.task.is.map mapred.task.partition map.input.file map.input.start map.input.length mapred.work.output.dir String String String String String boolean int String long long String Type The job id job.jar location in job directory The job specific shared scratch space The task id The task attempt id Is this a map task The id of the task within the job The filename that the map is reading from The offset of the start of the map input split The number of bytes in the map input split The task&#39;s temporary output directory Description
The standard output (stdout) and error (stderr) streams of the task are read by the TaskTracker and logged to ${HADOOP<em>LOG_DIR}/userlogs

Map/Reduce Tutorial
The DistributedCache can also be used to distribute both jars and native libraries for use in the map and/or reduce tasks. The child-jvm always has its current working directory added to the java.library.path and LD_LIBRARY_PATH. And hence the cached libraries can be loaded via System.loadLibrary or System.load. More details on how to load shared libraries through distributed cache are documented at native_libraries.html
6.4. Job Submission and Monitoring
JobClient is the primary interface by which user-job interacts with the JobTracker. JobClient provides facilities to submit jobs, track their progress, access component-tasks&#39; reports and logs, get the Map/Reduce cluster&#39;s status information and so on. The job submission process involves: 1. Checking the input and output specifications of the job. 2. Computing the InputSplit values for the job. 3. Setting up the requisite accounting information for the DistributedCache of the job, if necessary. 4. Copying the job&#39;s jar and configuration to the Map/Reduce system directory on the FileSystem. 5. Submitting the job to the JobTracker and optionally monitoring it&#39;s status. Job history files are also logged to user specified directory hadoop.job.history.user.location which defaults to job output directory. The files are stored in &quot;_logs/history/&quot; in the specified directory. Hence, by default they will be in mapred.output.dir/_logs/history. User can stop logging by giving the value none for hadoop.job.history.user.location User can view the history logs summary in specified directory using the following command $ bin/hadoop job -history output-dir This command will print job details, failed and killed tip details. More details about the job such as successful tasks and task attempts made for each task can be viewed using the following command $ bin/hadoop job -history all output-dir User can use OutputLogFilter to filter log files from the output directory listing. Normally the user creates the application, describes various facets of the job via JobConf, and then uses the JobClient to submit the job and monitor its progress. 6.4.1. Job Control Users may need to chain Map/Reduce jobs to accomplish complex tasks which cannot be

Map/Reduce Tutorial
done via a single Map/Reduce job. This is fairly easy since the output of the job typically goes to distributed file-system, and the output, in turn, can be used as the input for the next job. However, this also means that the onus on ensuring jobs are complete (success/failure) lies squarely on the clients. In such cases, the various job-control options are: • runJob(JobConf) : Submits the job and returns only after the job has completed. • submitJob(JobConf) : Only submits the job, then poll the returned handle to the RunningJob to query status and make scheduling decisions. • JobConf.setJobEndNotificationURI(String) : Sets up a notification upon job-completion, thus avoiding polling.
6.5. Job Input
InputFormat describes the input-specification for a Map/Reduce job. The Map/Reduce framework relies on the InputFormat of the job to: 1. Validate the input-specification of the job. 2. Split-up the input file(s) into logical InputSplit instances, each of which is then assigned to an individual Mapper. 3. Provide the RecordReader implementation used to glean input records from the logical InputSplit for processing by the Mapper. The default behavior of file-based InputFormat implementations, typically sub-classes of FileInputFormat, is to split the input into logical InputSplit instances based on the total size, in bytes, of the input files. However, the FileSystem blocksize of the input files is treated as an upper bound for input splits. A lower bound on the split size can be set via mapred.min.split.size. Clearly, logical splits based on input-size is insufficient for many applications since record boundaries must be respected. In such cases, the application should implement a RecordReader, who is responsible for respecting record-boundaries and presents a record-oriented view of the logical InputSplit to the individual task. TextInputFormat is the default InputFormat. If TextInputFormat is the InputFormat for a given job, the framework detects input-files with the .gz extensions and automatically decompresses them using the appropriate CompressionCodec. However, it must be noted that compressed files with the above extensions cannot be split and each compressed file is processed in its entirety by a single mapper.

6.5.1. InputSplit InputSplit represents the data to be processed by an individual Mapper. Typically InputSplit presents a byte-oriented view of the input, and it is the responsibility of RecordReader to process and present a record-oriented view. FileSplit is the default InputSplit. It sets map.input.file to the path of the input file for the logical split. 6.5.2. RecordReader RecordReader reads <key, value> pairs from an InputSplit. Typically the RecordReader converts the byte-oriented view of the input, provided by the InputSplit, and presents a record-oriented to the Mapper implementations for processing. RecordReader thus assumes the responsibility of processing record boundaries and presents the tasks with keys and values.
6.6. Job Output
OutputFormat describes the output-specification for a Map/Reduce job. The Map/Reduce framework relies on the OutputFormat of the job to: 1. Validate the output-specification of the job; for example, check that the output directory doesn&#39;t already exist. 2. Provide the RecordWriter implementation used to write the output files of the job. Output files are stored in a FileSystem. TextOutputFormat is the default OutputFormat. 6.6.1. OutputCommitter OutputCommitter describes the commit of task output for a Map/Reduce job. The Map/Reduce framework relies on the OutputCommitter of the job to: 1. Setup the job during initialization. For example, create the temporary output directory for the job during the initialization of the job. Job setup is done by a separate task when the job is in PREP state and after initializing tasks. Once the setup task completes, the job will be moved to RUNNING state. 2. Cleanup the job after the job completion. For example, remove the temporary output directory after the job completion. Job cleanup is done by a separate task at the end of the

Map/Reduce Tutorial
job. Job is declared SUCCEDED/FAILED/KILLED after the cleanup task completes. 3. Setup the task temporary output. Task setup is done as part of the same task, during task initialization. 4. Check whether a task needs a commit. This is to avoid the commit procedure if a task does not need commit. 5. Commit of the task output. Once task is done, the task will commit it&#39;s output if required. 6. Discard the task commit. If the task has been failed/killed, the output will be cleaned-up. If task could not cleanup (in exception block), a separate task will be launched with same attempt-id to do the cleanup. FileOutputCommitter is the default OutputCommitter. Job setup/cleanup tasks occupy map or reduce slots, whichever is free on the TaskTracker. And JobCleanup task, TaskCleanup tasks and JobSetup task have the highest priority, and in that order. 6.6.2. Task Side-Effect Files In some applications, component tasks need to create and/or write to side-files, which differ from the actual job-output files. In such cases there could be issues with two instances of the same Mapper or Reducer running simultaneously (for example, speculative tasks) trying to open and/or write to the same file (path) on the FileSystem. Hence the application-writer will have to pick unique names per task-attempt (using the attemptid, say attempt_200709221812_0001_m_000000_0), not just per task. To avoid these issues the Map/Reduce framework, when the OutputCommitter is FileOutputCommitter, maintains a special ${mapred.output.dir}/_temporary/</em>${taskid} sub-directory accessible via ${mapred.work.output.dir} for each task-attempt on the FileSystem where the output of the task-attempt is stored. On successful completion of the task-attempt, the files in the ${mapred.output.dir}/<em>temporary/</em>${taskid} (only) are promoted to ${mapred.output.dir}. Of course, the framework discards the sub-directory of unsuccessful task-attempts. This process is completely transparent to the application. The application-writer can take advantage of this feature by creating any side-files required in ${mapred.work.output.dir} during execution of a task via FileOutputFormat.getWorkOutputPath(), and the framework will promote them similarly for succesful task-attempts, thus eliminating the need to pick unique paths per task-attempt. Note: The value of ${mapred.work.output.dir} during execution of a particular task-attempt is actually ${mapred.output.dir}/<em>temporary/</em>{$taskid}, and this value is set by the Map/Reduce framework. So, just create any side-files in the path returned by FileOutputFormat.getWorkOutputPath() from map/reduce task to take advantage

Map/Reduce Tutorial
of this feature. The entire discussion holds true for maps of jobs with reducer=NONE (i.e. 0 reduces) since output of the map, in that case, goes directly to HDFS. 6.6.3. RecordWriter RecordWriter writes the output <key, value> pairs to an output file. RecordWriter implementations write the job outputs to the FileSystem.
6.7. Other Useful Features
6.7.1. Submitting Jobs to Queues Users submit jobs to Queues. Queues, as collection of jobs, allow the system to provide specific functionality. For example, queues use ACLs to control which users who can submit jobs to them. Queues are expected to be primarily used by Hadoop Schedulers. Hadoop comes configured with a single mandatory queue, called &#39;default&#39;. Queue names are defined in the mapred.queue.names property of the Hadoop site configuration. Some job schedulers, such as the Capacity Scheduler, support multiple queues. A job defines the queue it needs to be submitted to through the mapred.job.queue.name property, or through the setQueueName(String) API. Setting the queue name is optional. If a job is submitted without an associated queue name, it is submitted to the &#39;default&#39; queue. 6.7.2. Counters Counters represent global counters, defined either by the Map/Reduce framework or applications. Each Counter can be of any Enum type. Counters of a particular Enum are bunched into groups of type Counters.Group. Applications can define arbitrary Counters (of type Enum) and update them via Reporter.incrCounter(Enum, long) or Reporter.incrCounter(String, String, long) in the map and/or reduce methods. These counters are then globally aggregated by the framework. 6.7.3. DistributedCache DistributedCache distributes application-specific, large, read-only files efficiently. DistributedCache is a facility provided by the Map/Reduce framework to cache files
Page 25

Map/Reduce Tutorial
(text, archives, jars and so on) needed by applications. Applications specify the files to be cached via urls (hdfs://) in the JobConf. The DistributedCache assumes that the files specified via hdfs:// urls are already present on the FileSystem. The framework will copy the necessary files to the slave node before any tasks for the job are executed on that node. Its efficiency stems from the fact that the files are only copied once per job and the ability to cache archives which are un-archived on the slaves. DistributedCache tracks the modification timestamps of the cached files. Clearly the cache files should not be modified by the application or externally while the job is executing. DistributedCache can be used to distribute simple, read-only data/text files and more complex types such as archives and jars. Archives (zip, tar, tgz and tar.gz files) are un-archived at the slave nodes. Files have execution permissions set. The files/archives can be distributed by setting the property mapred.cache.{files|archives}. If more than one file/archive has to be distributed, they can be added as comma separated paths. The properties can also be set by APIs DistributedCache.addCacheFile(URI,conf)/ DistributedCache.addCacheArchive(URI,conf) and DistributedCache.setCacheFiles(URIs,conf)/ DistributedCache.setCacheArchives(URIs,conf) where URI is of the form hdfs://host:port/absolute-path/#link-name. In Streaming, the files can be distributed through command line option -cacheFile/-cacheArchive. Optionally users can also direct the DistributedCache to symlink the cached file(s) into the current working directory of the task via the DistributedCache.createSymlink(Configuration) api. Or by setting the configuration property mapred.create.symlink as yes. The DistributedCache will use the fragment of the URI as the name of the symlink. For example, the URI hdfs://namenode:port/lib.so.1/#lib.so will have the symlink name as lib.so in task&#39;s cwd for the file lib.so.1 in distributed cache. The DistributedCache can also be used as a rudimentary software distribution mechanism for use in the map and/or reduce tasks. It can be used to distribute both jars and native libraries. The DistributedCache.addArchiveToClassPath(Path, Configuration) or DistributedCache.addFileToClassPath(Path, Configuration) api can be used to cache files/jars and also add them to the classpath of child-jvm. The same can be done by setting the configuration properties mapred.job.classpath.{files|archives}. Similarly the cached files that are symlinked into the working directory of the task can be used to distribute native libraries and load them.

Map/Reduce Tutorial
6.7.4. Tool The Tool interface supports the handling of generic Hadoop command-line options. Tool is the standard for any Map/Reduce tool or application. The application should delegate the handling of standard command-line options to GenericOptionsParser via ToolRunner.run(Tool, String[]) and only handle its custom arguments. The generic Hadoop command-line options are: -conf <configuration file> -D <property=value> -fs <local|namenode:port> -jt <local|jobtracker:port> 6.7.5. IsolationRunner IsolationRunner is a utility to help debug Map/Reduce programs. To use the IsolationRunner, first set keep.failed.tasks.files to true (also see keep.tasks.files.pattern). Next, go to the node on which the failed task ran and go to the TaskTracker&#39;s local directory and run the IsolationRunner: $ cd <local path>/taskTracker/${taskid}/work $ bin/hadoop org.apache.hadoop.mapred.IsolationRunner ../job.xml IsolationRunner will run the failed task in a single jvm, which can be in the debugger, over precisely the same input. 6.7.6. Profiling Profiling is a utility to get a representative (2 or 3) sample of built-in java profiler for a sample of maps and reduces. User can specify whether the system should collect profiler information for some of the tasks in the job by setting the configuration property mapred.task.profile. The value can be set using the api JobConf.setProfileEnabled(boolean). If the value is set true, the task profiling is enabled. The profiler information is stored in the user log directory. By default, profiling is not enabled for the job. Once user configures that profiling is needed, she/he can use the configuration property mapred.task.profile.{maps|reduces} to set the ranges of map/reduce tasks to

Map/Reduce Tutorial
profile. The value can be set using the api JobConf.setProfileTaskRange(boolean,String). By default, the specified range is 0-2.
User can also specify the profiler configuration arguments by setting the configuration property mapred.task.profile.params. The value can be specified using the api JobConf.setProfileParams(String). If the string contains a %s, it will be replaced with the name of the profiling output file when the task runs. These parameters are passed to the task child JVM on the command line. The default value for the profiling parameters is -agentlib:hprof=cpu=samples,heap=sites,force=n,thread=y,verbose=n,file=%s 6.7.7. Debugging The Map/Reduce framework provides a facility to run user-provided scripts for debugging. When a map/reduce task fails, a user can run a debug script, to process task logs for example. The script is given access to the task&#39;s stdout and stderr outputs, syslog and jobconf. The output from the debug script&#39;s stdout and stderr is displayed on the console diagnostics and also as part of the job UI. In the following sections we discuss how to submit a debug script with a job. The script file needs to be distributed and submitted to the framework.
6.7.7.1. How to distribute the script file:
The user needs to use DistributedCache to distribute and symlink the script file.
6.7.7.2. How to submit the script:
A quick way to submit the debug script is to set values for the properties mapred.map.task.debug.script and mapred.reduce.task.debug.script, for debugging map and reduce tasks respectively. These properties can also be set by using APIs JobConf.setMapDebugScript(String) and JobConf.setReduceDebugScript(String) . In streaming mode, a debug script can be submitted with the command-line options -mapdebug and -reducedebug, for debugging map and reduce tasks respectively. The arguments to the script are the task&#39;s stdout, stderr, syslog and jobconf files. The debug command, run on the node where the map/reduce task failed, is: $script $stdout $stderr $syslog $jobconf Pipes programs have the c++ program name as a fifth argument for the command. Thus for the pipes programs the command is $script $stdout $stderr $syslog $jobconf $program

6.7.7.3. Default Behavior:
For pipes, a default script is run to process core dumps under gdb, prints stack trace and gives info about running threads. 6.7.8. JobControl JobControl is a utility which encapsulates a set of Map/Reduce jobs and their dependencies. 6.7.9. Data Compression Hadoop Map/Reduce provides facilities for the application-writer to specify compression for both intermediate map-outputs and the job-outputs i.e. output of the reduces. It also comes bundled with CompressionCodec implementation for the zlib compression algorithm. The gzip file format is also supported. Hadoop also provides native implementations of the above compression codecs for reasons of both performance (zlib) and non-availability of Java libraries. More details on their usage and availability are available here.
6.7.9.1. Intermediate Outputs
Applications can control compression of intermediate map-outputs via the JobConf.setCompressMapOutput(boolean) api and the CompressionCodec to be used via the JobConf.setMapOutputCompressorClass(Class) api.
6.7.9.2. Job Outputs
Applications can control compression of job-outputs via the FileOutputFormat.setCompressOutput(JobConf, boolean) api and the CompressionCodec to be used can be specified via the FileOutputFormat.setOutputCompressorClass(JobConf, Class) api. If the job outputs are to be stored in the SequenceFileOutputFormat, the required SequenceFile.CompressionType (i.e. RECORD / BLOCK - defaults to RECORD) can be specified via the SequenceFileOutputFormat.setOutputCompressionType(JobConf, SequenceFile.CompressionType) api. 6.7.10. Skipping Bad Records Hadoop provides an option where a certain set of bad input records can be skipped when processing map inputs. Applications can control this feature through the SkipBadRecords
Page 29

Map/Reduce Tutorial
class. This feature can be used when map tasks crash deterministically on certain input. This usually happens due to bugs in the map function. Usually, the user would have to fix these bugs. This is, however, not possible sometimes. The bug may be in third party libraries, for example, for which the source code is not available. In such cases, the task never completes successfully even after multiple attempts, and the job fails. With this feature, only a small portion of data surrounding the bad records is lost, which may be acceptable for some applications (those performing statistical analysis on very large data, for example). By default this feature is disabled. For enabling it, refer to SkipBadRecords.setMapperMaxSkipRecords(Configuration, long) and SkipBadRecords.setReducerMaxSkipGroups(Configuration, long). With this feature enabled, the framework gets into &#39;skipping mode&#39; after a certain number of map failures. For more details, see SkipBadRecords.setAttemptsToStartSkipping(Configuration, int). In &#39;skipping mode&#39;, map tasks maintain the range of records being processed. To do this, the framework relies on the processed record counter. See SkipBadRecords.COUNTER_MAP_PROCESSED_RECORDS and SkipBadRecords.COUNTER_REDUCE_PROCESSED_GROUPS. This counter enables the framework to know how many records have been processed successfully, and hence, what record range caused a task to crash. On further attempts, this range of records is skipped. The number of records skipped depends on how frequently the processed record counter is incremented by the application. It is recommended that this counter be incremented after every record is processed. This may not be possible in some applications that typically batch their processing. In such cases, the framework may skip additional records surrounding the bad record. Users can control the number of skipped records through SkipBadRecords.setMapperMaxSkipRecords(Configuration, long) and SkipBadRecords.setReducerMaxSkipGroups(Configuration, long). The framework tries to narrow the range of skipped records using a binary search-like approach. The skipped range is divided into two halves and only one half gets executed. On subsequent failures, the framework figures out which half contains bad records. A task will be re-executed till the acceptable skipped value is met or all task attempts are exhausted. To increase the number of task attempts, use JobConf.setMaxMapAttempts(int) and JobConf.setMaxReduceAttempts(int). Skipped records are written to HDFS in the sequence file format, for later analysis. The location can be changed through SkipBadRecords.setSkipOutputPath(JobConf, Path).</li>

Here is a more complete WordCount which uses many of the features provided by the Map/Reduce framework we discussed so far. This needs the HDFS to be up and running, especially for the DistributedCache-related features. Hence it only works with a pseudo-distributed or fully-distributed Hadoop installation.

7.3. Highlights
The second version of WordCount improves upon the previous one by using some features offered by the Map/Reduce framework: • Demonstrates how applications can access configuration parameters in the configure method of the Mapper (and Reducer) implementations (lines 28-43). • Demonstrates how the DistributedCache can be used to distribute read-only data needed by the jobs. Here it allows the user to specify word-patterns to skip while counting (line 104). • Demonstrates the utility of the Tool interface and the GenericOptionsParser to handle generic Hadoop command-line options (lines 87-116, 119). • Demonstrates how applications can use Counters (line 68) and how they can set application-specific status information via the Reporter instance passed to the map (and reduce) method (line 72).

Abstract
MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. Many real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown in the paper. Programs written in this functional style are automatically parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines. The run-time system takes care of the details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the program’s execution across a set of machines, handling machine failures, and managing the required inter-machine communication. This allows programmers without any experience with parallel and distributed systems to easily utilize the resources of a large distributed system. Our implementation of MapReduce runs on a large cluster of commodity machines and is highly scalable: a typical MapReduce computation processes many terabytes of data on thousands of machines. Programmers ﬁnd the system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce programs have been implemented and upwards of one thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google’s clusters every day.
1 Introduction
Over the past ﬁve years, the authors and many others at Google have implemented hundreds of special-purpose computations that process large amounts of raw data, such as crawled documents, web request logs, etc., to compute various kinds of derived data, such as inverted indices, various representations of the graph structure of web documents, summaries of the number of pages crawled per host, the set of most frequent queries in a To appear in OSDI 2004
given day, etc. Most such computations are conceptually straightforward. However, the input data is usually large and the computations have to be distributed across hundreds or thousands of machines in order to ﬁnish in a reasonable amount of time. The issues of how to parallelize the computation, distribute the data, and handle failures conspire to obscure the original simple computation with large amounts of complex code to deal with these issues. As a reaction to this complexity, we designed a new abstraction that allows us to express the simple computations we were trying to perform but hides the messy details of parallelization, fault-tolerance, data distribution and load balancing in a library. Our abstraction is inspired by the map and reduce primitives present in Lisp and many other functional languages. We realized that most of our computations involved applying a map operation to each logical “record” in our input in order to compute a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and then applying a reduce operation to all the values that shared the same key, in order to combine the derived data appropriately. Our use of a functional model with userspeciﬁed map and reduce operations allows us to parallelize large computations easily and to use re-execution as the primary mechanism for fault tolerance. The major contributions of this work are a simple and powerful interface that enables automatic parallelization and distribution of large-scale computations, combined with an implementation of this interface that achieves high performance on large clusters of commodity PCs. Section 2 describes the basic programming model and gives several examples. Section 3 describes an implementation of the MapReduce interface tailored towards our cluster-based computing environment. Section 4 describes several reﬁnements of the programming model that we have found useful. Section 5 has performance measurements of our implementation for a variety of tasks. Section 6 explores the use of MapReduce within Google including our experiences in using it as the basis 1
for a rewrite of our production indexing system. Section 7 discusses related and future work.
2.2 Types
Even though the previous pseudo-code is written in terms of string inputs and outputs, conceptually the map and reduce functions supplied by the user have associated types: map reduce (k1,v1) (k2,list(v2)) → list(k2,v2) → list(v2)
2 Programming Model
The computation takes a set of input key/value pairs, and produces a set of output key/value pairs. The user of the MapReduce library expresses the computation as two functions: Map and Reduce. Map, written by the user, takes an input pair and produces a set of intermediate key/value pairs. The MapReduce library groups together all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key I and passes them to the Reduce function. The Reduce function, also written by the user, accepts an intermediate key I and a set of values for that key. It merges together these values to form a possibly smaller set of values. Typically just zero or one output value is produced per Reduce invocation. The intermediate values are supplied to the user’s reduce function via an iterator. This allows us to handle lists of values that are too large to ﬁt in memory.
I.e., the input keys and values are drawn from a different domain than the output keys and values. Furthermore, the intermediate keys and values are from the same domain as the output keys and values. Our C++ implementation passes strings to and from the user-deﬁned functions and leaves it to the user code to convert between strings and appropriate types.
2.3 More Examples
Here are a few simple examples of interesting programs that can be easily expressed as MapReduce computations. Distributed Grep: The map function emits a line if it matches a supplied pattern. The reduce function is an identity function that just copies the supplied intermediate data to the output. Count of URL Access Frequency: The map function processes logs of web page requests and outputs URL, 1 . The reduce function adds together all values for the same URL and emits a URL, total count pair. Reverse Web-Link Graph: The map function outputs target, source pairs for each link to a target URL found in a page named source. The reduce function concatenates the list of all source URLs associated with a given target URL and emits the pair: target, list(source) Term-Vector per Host: A term vector summarizes the most important words that occur in a document or a set of documents as a list of word, f requency pairs. The map function emits a hostname, term vector pair for each input document (where the hostname is extracted from the URL of the document). The reduce function is passed all per-document term vectors for a given host. It adds these term vectors together, throwing away infrequent terms, and then emits a ﬁnal hostname, term vector pair. 2
2.1 Example
Consider the problem of counting the number of occurrences of each word in a large collection of documents. The user would write code similar to the following pseudo-code:
map(String key, String value): // key: document name // value: document contents for each word w in value: EmitIntermediate(w, &quot;1&quot;); reduce(String key, Iterator values): // key: a word // values: a list of counts int result = 0; for each v in values: result += ParseInt(v); Emit(AsString(result));
The map function emits each word plus an associated count of occurrences (just ‘1’ in this simple example). The reduce function sums together all counts emitted for a particular word. In addition, the user writes code to ﬁll in a mapreduce speciﬁcation object with the names of the input and output ﬁles, and optional tuning parameters. The user then invokes the MapReduce function, passing it the speciﬁcation object. The user’s code is linked together with the MapReduce library (implemented in C++).

Figure 1: Execution overview Inverted Index: The map function parses each document, and emits a sequence of word, document ID pairs. The reduce function accepts all pairs for a given word, sorts the corresponding document IDs and emits a word, list(document ID) pair. The set of all output pairs forms a simple inverted index. It is easy to augment this computation to keep track of word positions. Distributed Sort: The map function extracts the key from each record, and emits a key, record pair. The reduce function emits all pairs unchanged. This computation depends on the partitioning facilities described in Section 4.1 and the ordering properties described in Section 4.2. large clusters of commodity PCs connected together with switched Ethernet [4]. In our environment: (1) Machines are typically dual-processor x86 processors running Linux, with 2-4 GB of memory per machine. (2) Commodity networking hardware is used – typically either 100 megabits/second or 1 gigabit/second at the machine level, but averaging considerably less in overall bisection bandwidth. (3) A cluster consists of hundreds or thousands of machines, and therefore machine failures are common. (4) Storage is provided by inexpensive IDE disks attached directly to individual machines. A distributed ﬁle system [8] developed in-house is used to manage the data stored on these disks. The ﬁle system uses replication to provide availability and reliability on top of unreliable hardware. (5) Users submit jobs to a scheduling system. Each job consists of a set of tasks, and is mapped by the scheduler to a set of available machines within a cluster.
3 Implementation
Many different implementations of the MapReduce interface are possible. The right choice depends on the environment. For example, one implementation may be suitable for a small shared-memory machine, another for a large NUMA multi-processor, and yet another for an even larger collection of networked machines. This section describes an implementation targeted to the computing environment in wide use at Google: To appear in OSDI 2004
3.1 Execution Overview
The Map invocations are distributed across multiple machines by automatically partitioning the input data 3
into a set of M splits. The input splits can be processed in parallel by different machines. Reduce invocations are distributed by partitioning the intermediate key space into R pieces using a partitioning function (e.g., hash(key) mod R). The number of partitions (R) and the partitioning function are speciﬁed by the user. Figure 1 shows the overall ﬂow of a MapReduce operation in our implementation. When the user program calls the MapReduce function, the following sequence of actions occurs (the numbered labels in Figure 1 correspond to the numbers in the list below): 1. The MapReduce library in the user program ﬁrst splits the input ﬁles into M pieces of typically 16 megabytes to 64 megabytes (MB) per piece (controllable by the user via an optional parameter). It then starts up many copies of the program on a cluster of machines. 2. One of the copies of the program is special – the master. The rest are workers that are assigned work by the master. There are M map tasks and R reduce tasks to assign. The master picks idle workers and assigns each one a map task or a reduce task. 3. A worker who is assigned a map task reads the contents of the corresponding input split. It parses key/value pairs out of the input data and passes each pair to the user-deﬁned Map function. The intermediate key/value pairs produced by the Map function are buffered in memory. 4. Periodically, the buffered pairs are written to local disk, partitioned into R regions by the partitioning function. The locations of these buffered pairs on the local disk are passed back to the master, who is responsible for forwarding these locations to the reduce workers. 5. When a reduce worker is notiﬁed by the master about these locations, it uses remote procedure calls to read the buffered data from the local disks of the map workers. When a reduce worker has read all intermediate data, it sorts it by the intermediate keys so that all occurrences of the same key are grouped together. The sorting is needed because typically many different keys map to the same reduce task. If the amount of intermediate data is too large to ﬁt in memory, an external sort is used. 6. The reduce worker iterates over the sorted intermediate data and for each unique intermediate key encountered, it passes the key and the corresponding set of intermediate values to the user’s Reduce function. The output of the Reduce function is appended to a ﬁnal output ﬁle for this reduce partition. To appear in OSDI 2004</p>
<ol>
<li>When all map tasks and reduce tasks have been completed, the master wakes up the user program. At this point, the MapReduce call in the user program returns back to the user code. After successful completion, the output of the mapreduce execution is available in the R output ﬁles (one per reduce task, with ﬁle names as speciﬁed by the user). Typically, users do not need to combine these R output ﬁles into one ﬁle – they often pass these ﬁles as input to another MapReduce call, or use them from another distributed application that is able to deal with input that is partitioned into multiple ﬁles.
3.2 Master Data Structures
The master keeps several data structures. For each map task and reduce task, it stores the state (idle, in-progress, or completed), and the identity of the worker machine (for non-idle tasks). The master is the conduit through which the location of intermediate ﬁle regions is propagated from map tasks to reduce tasks. Therefore, for each completed map task, the master stores the locations and sizes of the R intermediate ﬁle regions produced by the map task. Updates to this location and size information are received as map tasks are completed. The information is pushed incrementally to workers that have in-progress reduce tasks.
3.3 Fault Tolerance
Since the MapReduce library is designed to help process very large amounts of data using hundreds or thousands of machines, the library must tolerate machine failures gracefully. Worker Failure The master pings every worker periodically. If no response is received from a worker in a certain amount of time, the master marks the worker as failed. Any map tasks completed by the worker are reset back to their initial idle state, and therefore become eligible for scheduling on other workers. Similarly, any map task or reduce task in progress on a failed worker is also reset to idle and becomes eligible for rescheduling. Completed map tasks are re-executed on a failure because their output is stored on the local disk(s) of the failed machine and is therefore inaccessible. Completed reduce tasks do not need to be re-executed since their output is stored in a global ﬁle system. When a map task is executed ﬁrst by worker A and then later executed by worker B (because A failed), all 4
workers executing reduce tasks are notiﬁed of the reexecution. Any reduce task that has not already read the data from worker A will read the data from worker B. MapReduce is resilient to large-scale worker failures. For example, during one MapReduce operation, network maintenance on a running cluster was causing groups of 80 machines at a time to become unreachable for several minutes. The MapReduce master simply re-executed the work done by the unreachable worker machines, and continued to make forward progress, eventually completing the MapReduce operation. Master Failure It is easy to make the master write periodic checkpoints of the master data structures described above. If the master task dies, a new copy can be started from the last checkpointed state. However, given that there is only a single master, its failure is unlikely; therefore our current implementation aborts the MapReduce computation if the master fails. Clients can check for this condition and retry the MapReduce operation if they desire. Semantics in the Presence of Failures When the user-supplied map and reduce operators are deterministic functions of their input values, our distributed implementation produces the same output as would have been produced by a non-faulting sequential execution of the entire program. We rely on atomic commits of map and reduce task outputs to achieve this property. Each in-progress task writes its output to private temporary ﬁles. A reduce task produces one such ﬁle, and a map task produces R such ﬁles (one per reduce task). When a map task completes, the worker sends a message to the master and includes the names of the R temporary ﬁles in the message. If the master receives a completion message for an already completed map task, it ignores the message. Otherwise, it records the names of R ﬁles in a master data structure. When a reduce task completes, the reduce worker atomically renames its temporary output ﬁle to the ﬁnal output ﬁle. If the same reduce task is executed on multiple machines, multiple rename calls will be executed for the same ﬁnal output ﬁle. We rely on the atomic rename operation provided by the underlying ﬁle system to guarantee that the ﬁnal ﬁle system state contains just the data produced by one execution of the reduce task. The vast majority of our map and reduce operators are deterministic, and the fact that our semantics are equivalent to a sequential execution in this case makes it very To appear in OSDI 2004
easy for programmers to reason about their program’s behavior. When the map and/or reduce operators are nondeterministic, we provide weaker but still reasonable semantics. In the presence of non-deterministic operators, the output of a particular reduce task R1 is equivalent to the output for R1 produced by a sequential execution of the non-deterministic program. However, the output for a different reduce task R2 may correspond to the output for R2 produced by a different sequential execution of the non-deterministic program. Consider map task M and reduce tasks R1 and R2 . Let e(Ri ) be the execution of Ri that committed (there is exactly one such execution). The weaker semantics arise because e(R1 ) may have read the output produced by one execution of M and e(R2 ) may have read the output produced by a different execution of M .
3.4 Locality
Network bandwidth is a relatively scarce resource in our computing environment. We conserve network bandwidth by taking advantage of the fact that the input data (managed by GFS [8]) is stored on the local disks of the machines that make up our cluster. GFS divides each ﬁle into 64 MB blocks, and stores several copies of each block (typically 3 copies) on different machines. The MapReduce master takes the location information of the input ﬁles into account and attempts to schedule a map task on a machine that contains a replica of the corresponding input data. Failing that, it attempts to schedule a map task near a replica of that task’s input data (e.g., on a worker machine that is on the same network switch as the machine containing the data). When running large MapReduce operations on a signiﬁcant fraction of the workers in a cluster, most input data is read locally and consumes no network bandwidth.
3.5 Task Granularity
We subdivide the map phase into M pieces and the reduce phase into R pieces, as described above. Ideally, M and R should be much larger than the number of worker machines. Having each worker perform many different tasks improves dynamic load balancing, and also speeds up recovery when a worker fails: the many map tasks it has completed can be spread out across all the other worker machines. There are practical bounds on how large M and R can be in our implementation, since the master must make O(M + R) scheduling decisions and keeps O(M ∗ R) state in memory as described above. (The constant factors for memory usage are small however: the O(M ∗ R) piece of the state consists of approximately one byte of data per map task/reduce task pair.) 5
Furthermore, R is often constrained by users because the output of each reduce task ends up in a separate output ﬁle. In practice, we tend to choose M so that each individual task is roughly 16 MB to 64 MB of input data (so that the locality optimization described above is most effective), and we make R a small multiple of the number of worker machines we expect to use. We often perform MapReduce computations with M = 200, 000 and R = 5, 000, using 2,000 worker machines.
3.6 Backup Tasks
One of the common causes that lengthens the total time taken for a MapReduce operation is a “straggler”: a machine that takes an unusually long time to complete one of the last few map or reduce tasks in the computation. Stragglers can arise for a whole host of reasons. For example, a machine with a bad disk may experience frequent correctable errors that slow its read performance from 30 MB/s to 1 MB/s. The cluster scheduling system may have scheduled other tasks on the machine, causing it to execute the MapReduce code more slowly due to competition for CPU, memory, local disk, or network bandwidth. A recent problem we experienced was a bug in machine initialization code that caused processor caches to be disabled: computations on affected machines slowed down by over a factor of one hundred. We have a general mechanism to alleviate the problem of stragglers. When a MapReduce operation is close to completion, the master schedules backup executions of the remaining in-progress tasks. The task is marked as completed whenever either the primary or the backup execution completes. We have tuned this mechanism so that it typically increases the computational resources used by the operation by no more than a few percent. We have found that this signiﬁcantly reduces the time to complete large MapReduce operations. As an example, the sort program described in Section 5.3 takes 44% longer to complete when the backup task mechanism is disabled.
the intermediate key. A default partitioning function is provided that uses hashing (e.g. “hash(key) mod R”). This tends to result in fairly well-balanced partitions. In some cases, however, it is useful to partition data by some other function of the key. For example, sometimes the output keys are URLs, and we want all entries for a single host to end up in the same output ﬁle. To support situations like this, the user of the MapReduce library can provide a special partitioning function. For example, using “hash(Hostname(urlkey)) mod R” as the partitioning function causes all URLs from the same host to end up in the same output ﬁle.
4.2 Ordering Guarantees
We guarantee that within a given partition, the intermediate key/value pairs are processed in increasing key order. This ordering guarantee makes it easy to generate a sorted output ﬁle per partition, which is useful when the output ﬁle format needs to support efﬁcient random access lookups by key, or users of the output ﬁnd it convenient to have the data sorted.
4.3 Combiner Function
In some cases, there is signiﬁcant repetition in the intermediate keys produced by each map task, and the userspeciﬁed Reduce function is commutative and associative. A good example of this is the word counting example in Section 2.1. Since word frequencies tend to follow a Zipf distribution, each map task will produce hundreds or thousands of records of the form <the, 1>. All of these counts will be sent over the network to a single reduce task and then added together by the Reduce function to produce one number. We allow the user to specify an optional Combiner function that does partial merging of this data before it is sent over the network. The Combiner function is executed on each machine that performs a map task. Typically the same code is used to implement both the combiner and the reduce functions. The only difference between a reduce function and a combiner function is how the MapReduce library handles the output of the function. The output of a reduce function is written to the ﬁnal output ﬁle. The output of a combiner function is written to an intermediate ﬁle that will be sent to a reduce task. Partial combining signiﬁcantly speeds up certain classes of MapReduce operations. Appendix A contains an example that uses a combiner.
4 Reﬁnements
Although the basic functionality provided by simply writing Map and Reduce functions is sufﬁcient for most needs, we have found a few extensions useful. These are described in this section.
4.1 Partitioning Function
The users of MapReduce specify the number of reduce tasks/output ﬁles that they desire (R). Data gets partitioned across these tasks using a partitioning function on To appear in OSDI 2004
4.4 Input and Output Types
The MapReduce library provides support for reading input data in several different formats. For example, “text” 6
mode input treats each line as a key/value pair: the key is the offset in the ﬁle and the value is the contents of the line. Another common supported format stores a sequence of key/value pairs sorted by key. Each input type implementation knows how to split itself into meaningful ranges for processing as separate map tasks (e.g. text mode’s range splitting ensures that range splits occur only at line boundaries). Users can add support for a new input type by providing an implementation of a simple reader interface, though most users just use one of a small number of predeﬁned input types. A reader does not necessarily need to provide data read from a ﬁle. For example, it is easy to deﬁne a reader that reads records from a database, or from data structures mapped in memory. In a similar fashion, we support a set of output types for producing data in different formats and it is easy for user code to add support for new output types.
the signal handler sends a “last gasp” UDP packet that contains the sequence number to the MapReduce master. When the master has seen more than one failure on a particular record, it indicates that the record should be skipped when it issues the next re-execution of the corresponding Map or Reduce task.
4.7 Local Execution
Debugging problems in Map or Reduce functions can be tricky, since the actual computation happens in a distributed system, often on several thousand machines, with work assignment decisions made dynamically by the master. To help facilitate debugging, proﬁling, and small-scale testing, we have developed an alternative implementation of the MapReduce library that sequentially executes all of the work for a MapReduce operation on the local machine. Controls are provided to the user so that the computation can be limited to particular map tasks. Users invoke their program with a special ﬂag and can then easily use any debugging or testing tools they ﬁnd useful (e.g. gdb).
4.5 Side-effects
In some cases, users of MapReduce have found it convenient to produce auxiliary ﬁles as additional outputs from their map and/or reduce operators. We rely on the application writer to make such side-effects atomic and idempotent. Typically the application writes to a temporary ﬁle and atomically renames this ﬁle once it has been fully generated. We do not provide support for atomic two-phase commits of multiple output ﬁles produced by a single task. Therefore, tasks that produce multiple output ﬁles with cross-ﬁle consistency requirements should be deterministic. This restriction has never been an issue in practice.
4.8 Status Information
The master runs an internal HTTP server and exports a set of status pages for human consumption. The status pages show the progress of the computation, such as how many tasks have been completed, how many are in progress, bytes of input, bytes of intermediate data, bytes of output, processing rates, etc. The pages also contain links to the standard error and standard output ﬁles generated by each task. The user can use this data to predict how long the computation will take, and whether or not more resources should be added to the computation. These pages can also be used to ﬁgure out when the computation is much slower than expected. In addition, the top-level status page shows which workers have failed, and which map and reduce tasks they were processing when they failed. This information is useful when attempting to diagnose bugs in the user code.
4.6 Skipping Bad Records
Sometimes there are bugs in user code that cause the Map or Reduce functions to crash deterministically on certain records. Such bugs prevent a MapReduce operation from completing. The usual course of action is to ﬁx the bug, but sometimes this is not feasible; perhaps the bug is in a third-party library for which source code is unavailable. Also, sometimes it is acceptable to ignore a few records, for example when doing statistical analysis on a large data set. We provide an optional mode of execution where the MapReduce library detects which records cause deterministic crashes and skips these records in order to make forward progress. Each worker process installs a signal handler that catches segmentation violations and bus errors. Before invoking a user Map or Reduce operation, the MapReduce library stores the sequence number of the argument in a global variable. If the user code generates a signal, To appear in OSDI 2004
4.9 Counters
The MapReduce library provides a counter facility to count occurrences of various events. For example, user code may want to count total number of words processed or the number of German documents indexed, etc. To use this facility, user code creates a named counter object and then increments the counter appropriately in the Map and/or Reduce function. For example: 7
Input (MB/s)
Counter/<em> uppercase; uppercase = GetCounter(&quot;uppercase&quot;); map(String name, String contents): for each word w in contents: if (IsCapitalized(w)): uppercase-&gt;Increment(); EmitIntermediate(w, &quot;1&quot;);
30000 20000 10000 0 20 40 60 80 100
The counter values from individual worker machines are periodically propagated to the master (piggybacked on the ping response). The master aggregates the counter values from successful map and reduce tasks and returns them to the user code when the MapReduce operation is completed. The current counter values are also displayed on the master status page so that a human can watch the progress of the live computation. When aggregating counter values, the master eliminates the effects of duplicate executions of the same map or reduce task to avoid double counting. (Duplicate executions can arise from our use of backup tasks and from re-execution of tasks due to failures.) Some counter values are automatically maintained by the MapReduce library, such as the number of input key/value pairs processed and the number of output key/value pairs produced. Users have found the counter facility useful for sanity checking the behavior of MapReduce operations. For example, in some MapReduce operations, the user code may want to ensure that the number of output pairs produced exactly equals the number of input pairs processed, or that the fraction of German documents processed is within some tolerable fraction of the total number of documents processed.
Seconds
Figure 2: Data transfer rate over time disks, and a gigabit Ethernet link. The machines were arranged in a two-level tree-shaped switched network with approximately 100-200 Gbps of aggregate bandwidth available at the root. All of the machines were in the same hosting facility and therefore the round-trip time between any pair of machines was less than a millisecond. Out of the 4GB of memory, approximately 1-1.5GB was reserved by other tasks running on the cluster. The programs were executed on a weekend afternoon, when the CPUs, disks, and network were mostly idle.
5.2 Grep
The grep program scans through 1010 100-byte records, searching for a relatively rare three-character pattern (the pattern occurs in 92,337 records). The input is split into approximately 64MB pieces (M = 15000), and the entire output is placed in one ﬁle (R = 1). Figure 2 shows the progress of the computation over time. The Y-axis shows the rate at which the input data is scanned. The rate gradually picks up as more machines are assigned to this MapReduce computation, and peaks at over 30 GB/s when 1764 workers have been assigned. As the map tasks ﬁnish, the rate starts dropping and hits zero about 80 seconds into the computation. The entire computation takes approximately 150 seconds from start to ﬁnish. This includes about a minute of startup overhead. The overhead is due to the propagation of the program to all worker machines, and delays interacting with GFS to open the set of 1000 input ﬁles and to get the information needed for the locality optimization.
5 Performance
In this section we measure the performance of MapReduce on two computations running on a large cluster of machines. One computation searches through approximately one terabyte of data looking for a particular pattern. The other computation sorts approximately one terabyte of data. These two programs are representative of a large subset of the real programs written by users of MapReduce – one class of programs shufﬂes data from one representation to another, and another class extracts a small amount of interesting data from a large data set.
5.3 Sort
The sort program sorts 1010 100-byte records (approximately 1 terabyte of data). This program is modeled after the TeraSort benchmark [10].

Figure 3: Data transfer rates over time for different executions of the sort program original text line as the intermediate key/value pair. We used a built-in Identity function as the Reduce operator. This functions passes the intermediate key/value pair unchanged as the output key/value pair. The ﬁnal sorted output is written to a set of 2-way replicated GFS ﬁles (i.e., 2 terabytes are written as the output of the program). As before, the input data is split into 64MB pieces (M = 15000). We partition the sorted output into 4000 ﬁles (R = 4000). The partitioning function uses the initial bytes of the key to segregate it into one of R pieces. Our partitioning function for this benchmark has builtin knowledge of the distribution of keys. In a general sorting program, we would add a pre-pass MapReduce operation that would collect a sample of the keys and use the distribution of the sampled keys to compute splitpoints for the ﬁnal sorting pass. Figure 3 (a) shows the progress of a normal execution of the sort program. The top-left graph shows the rate at which input is read. The rate peaks at about 13 GB/s and dies off fairly quickly since all map tasks ﬁnish before 200 seconds have elapsed. Note that the input rate is less than for grep. This is because the sort map tasks spend about half their time and I/O bandwidth writing intermediate output to their local disks. The corresponding intermediate output for grep had negligible size. The middle-left graph shows the rate at which data is sent over the network from the map tasks to the reduce tasks. This shufﬂing starts as soon as the ﬁrst map task completes. The ﬁrst hump in the graph is for To appear in OSDI 2004 the ﬁrst batch of approximately 1700 reduce tasks (the entire MapReduce was assigned about 1700 machines, and each machine executes at most one reduce task at a time). Roughly 300 seconds into the computation, some of these ﬁrst batch of reduce tasks ﬁnish and we start shufﬂing data for the remaining reduce tasks. All of the shufﬂing is done about 600 seconds into the computation. The bottom-left graph shows the rate at which sorted data is written to the ﬁnal output ﬁles by the reduce tasks. There is a delay between the end of the ﬁrst shufﬂing period and the start of the writing period because the machines are busy sorting the intermediate data. The writes continue at a rate of about 2-4 GB/s for a while. All of the writes ﬁnish about 850 seconds into the computation. Including startup overhead, the entire computation takes 891 seconds. This is similar to the current best reported result of 1057 seconds for the TeraSort benchmark [18]. A few things to note: the input rate is higher than the shufﬂe rate and the output rate because of our locality optimization – most data is read from a local disk and bypasses our relatively bandwidth constrained network. The shufﬂe rate is higher than the output rate because the output phase writes two copies of the sorted data (we make two replicas of the output for reliability and availability reasons). We write two replicas because that is the mechanism for reliability and availability provided by our underlying ﬁle system. Network bandwidth requirements for writing data would be reduced if the underlying ﬁle system used erasure coding [14] rather than replication. 9
In Figure 3 (b), we show an execution of the sort program with backup tasks disabled. The execution ﬂow is similar to that shown in Figure 3 (a), except that there is a very long tail where hardly any write activity occurs. After 960 seconds, all except 5 of the reduce tasks are completed. However these last few stragglers don’t ﬁnish until 300 seconds later. The entire computation takes 1283 seconds, an increase of 44% in elapsed time.

5.5 Machine Failures
In Figure 3 (c), we show an execution of the sort program where we intentionally killed 200 out of 1746 worker processes several minutes into the computation. The underlying cluster scheduler immediately restarted new worker processes on these machines (since only the processes were killed, the machines were still functioning properly). The worker deaths show up as a negative input rate since some previously completed map work disappears (since the corresponding map workers were killed) and needs to be redone. The re-execution of this map work happens relatively quickly. The entire computation ﬁnishes in 933 seconds including startup overhead (just an increase of 5% over the normal execution time).

6 Experience
We wrote the ﬁrst version of the MapReduce library in February of 2003, and made signiﬁcant enhancements to it in August of 2003, including the locality optimization, dynamic load balancing of task execution across worker machines, etc. Since that time, we have been pleasantly surprised at how broadly applicable the MapReduce library has been for the kinds of problems we work on. It has been used across a wide range of domains within Google, including: • large-scale machine learning problems, • clustering problems for the Google News and Froogle products, • extraction of data used to produce reports of popular queries (e.g. Google Zeitgeist), • extraction of properties of web pages for new experiments and products (e.g. extraction of geographical locations from a large corpus of web pages for localized search), and • large-scale graph computations. To appear in OSDI 2004
Table 1: MapReduce jobs run in August 2004 Figure 4 shows the signiﬁcant growth in the number of separate MapReduce programs checked into our primary source code management system over time, from 0 in early 2003 to almost 900 separate instances as of late September 2004. MapReduce has been so successful because it makes it possible to write a simple program and run it efﬁciently on a thousand machines in the course of half an hour, greatly speeding up the development and prototyping cycle. Furthermore, it allows programmers who have no experience with distributed and/or parallel systems to exploit large amounts of resources easily. At the end of each job, the MapReduce library logs statistics about the computational resources used by the job. In Table 1, we show some statistics for a subset of MapReduce jobs run at Google in August 2004.
6.1 Large-Scale Indexing
One of our most signiﬁcant uses of MapReduce to date has been a complete rewrite of the production index10
ing system that produces the data structures used for the Google web search service. The indexing system takes as input a large set of documents that have been retrieved by our crawling system, stored as a set of GFS ﬁles. The raw contents for these documents are more than 20 terabytes of data. The indexing process runs as a sequence of ﬁve to ten MapReduce operations. Using MapReduce (instead of the ad-hoc distributed passes in the prior version of the indexing system) has provided several beneﬁts: • The indexing code is simpler, smaller, and easier to understand, because the code that deals with fault tolerance, distribution and parallelization is hidden within the MapReduce library. For example, the size of one phase of the computation dropped from approximately 3800 lines of C++ code to approximately 700 lines when expressed using MapReduce. • The performance of the MapReduce library is good enough that we can keep conceptually unrelated computations separate, instead of mixing them together to avoid extra passes over the data. This makes it easy to change the indexing process. For example, one change that took a few months to make in our old indexing system took only a few days to implement in the new system. • The indexing process has become much easier to operate, because most of the problems caused by machine failures, slow machines, and networking hiccups are dealt with automatically by the MapReduce library without operator intervention. Furthermore, it is easy to improve the performance of the indexing process by adding new machines to the indexing cluster.
7 Related Work
Many systems have provided restricted programming models and used the restrictions to parallelize the computation automatically. For example, an associative function can be computed over all preﬁxes of an N element array in log N time on N processors using parallel preﬁx computations [6, 9, 13]. MapReduce can be considered a simpliﬁcation and distillation of some of these models based on our experience with large real-world computations. More signiﬁcantly, we provide a fault-tolerant implementation that scales to thousands of processors. In contrast, most of the parallel processing systems have only been implemented on smaller scales and leave the details of handling machine failures to the programmer. Bulk Synchronous Programming [17] and some MPI primitives [11] provide higher-level abstractions that To appear in OSDI 2004
make it easier for programmers to write parallel programs. A key difference between these systems and MapReduce is that MapReduce exploits a restricted programming model to parallelize the user program automatically and to provide transparent fault-tolerance. Our locality optimization draws its inspiration from techniques such as active disks [12, 15], where computation is pushed into processing elements that are close to local disks, to reduce the amount of data sent across I/O subsystems or the network. We run on commodity processors to which a small number of disks are directly connected instead of running directly on disk controller processors, but the general approach is similar. Our backup task mechanism is similar to the eager scheduling mechanism employed in the Charlotte System [3]. One of the shortcomings of simple eager scheduling is that if a given task causes repeated failures, the entire computation fails to complete. We ﬁx some instances of this problem with our mechanism for skipping bad records. The MapReduce implementation relies on an in-house cluster management system that is responsible for distributing and running user tasks on a large collection of shared machines. Though not the focus of this paper, the cluster management system is similar in spirit to other systems such as Condor [16]. The sorting facility that is a part of the MapReduce library is similar in operation to NOW-Sort [1]. Source machines (map workers) partition the data to be sorted and send it to one of R reduce workers. Each reduce worker sorts its data locally (in memory if possible). Of course NOW-Sort does not have the user-deﬁnable Map and Reduce functions that make our library widely applicable. River [2] provides a programming model where processes communicate with each other by sending data over distributed queues. Like MapReduce, the River system tries to provide good average case performance even in the presence of non-uniformities introduced by heterogeneous hardware or system perturbations. River achieves this by careful scheduling of disk and network transfers to achieve balanced completion times. MapReduce has a different approach. By restricting the programming model, the MapReduce framework is able to partition the problem into a large number of ﬁnegrained tasks. These tasks are dynamically scheduled on available workers so that faster workers process more tasks. The restricted programming model also allows us to schedule redundant executions of tasks near the end of the job which greatly reduces completion time in the presence of non-uniformities (such as slow or stuck workers). BAD-FS [5] has a very different programming model from MapReduce, and unlike MapReduce, is targeted to 11
the execution of jobs across a wide-area network. However, there are two fundamental similarities. (1) Both systems use redundant execution to recover from data loss caused by failures. (2) Both use locality-aware scheduling to reduce the amount of data sent across congested network links. TACC [7] is a system designed to simplify construction of highly-available networked services. Like MapReduce, it relies on re-execution as a mechanism for implementing fault-tolerance.
8 Conclusions
The MapReduce programming model has been successfully used at Google for many different purposes. We attribute this success to several reasons. First, the model is easy to use, even for programmers without experience with parallel and distributed systems, since it hides the details of parallelization, fault-tolerance, locality optimization, and load balancing. Second, a large variety of problems are easily expressible as MapReduce computations. For example, MapReduce is used for the generation of data for Google’s production web search service, for sorting, for data mining, for machine learning, and many other systems. Third, we have developed an implementation of MapReduce that scales to large clusters of machines comprising thousands of machines. The implementation makes efﬁcient use of these machine resources and therefore is suitable for use on many of the large computational problems encountered at Google. We have learned several things from this work. First, restricting the programming model makes it easy to parallelize and distribute computations and to make such computations fault-tolerant. Second, network bandwidth is a scarce resource. A number of optimizations in our system are therefore targeted at reducing the amount of data sent across the network: the locality optimization allows us to read data from local disks, and writing a single copy of the intermediate data to local disk saves network bandwidth. Third, redundant execution can be used to reduce the impact of slow machines, and to handle machine failures and data loss.

<p>cut是一个选取命令，就是将一段数据经过分析，取出我们想要的。一般来说，选取信息通常是针对“行”来进行分析的，并不是整篇信息分析的。</p>
<p>（1）其语法格式为：
cut  [-bn] [file] 或 cut [-c] [file]  或  cut [-df] [file]</p>
<p>使用说明
cut 命令从文件的每一行剪切字节、字符和字段并将这些字节、字符和字段写至标准输出。
如果不指定 File 参数，cut 命令将读取标准输入。必须指定 -b、-c 或 -f 标志之一。</p>
<p>主要参数
-b ：以字节为单位进行分割。这些字节位置将忽略多字节字符边界，除非也指定了 -n 标志。
-c ：以字符为单位进行分割。
-d ：自定义分隔符，默认为制表符。
-f  ：与-d一起使用，指定显示哪个区域。
-n ：取消分割多字节字符。仅和 -b 标志一起使用。如果字符的最后一个字节落在由 -b 标志的 List 参数指示的<br />范围之内，该字符将被写出；否则，该字符将被排除。</p>
<p>（2）cut一般以什么为依据呢? 也就是说，我怎么告诉cut我想定位到的剪切内容呢?</p>
<p>cut命令主要是接受三个定位方法：</p>
<p>第一，字节（bytes），用选项-b</p>
<p>第二，字符（characters），用选项-c</p>
<p>第三，域（fields），用选项-f</p>
<p>（3）以“字节”定位</p>
<p>举个例子吧，当你执行ps命令时，会输出类似如下的内容：</p>
<p>[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ who
rocrocket :0           2009-01-08 11:07
rocrocket pts/0        2009-01-08 11:23 (:0.0)
rocrocket pts/1        2009-01-08 14:15 (:0.0)
如果我们想提取每一行的第3个字节，就这样：</p>
<p>[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ who|cut -b 3
c
c
c</p>
<p>（4） 如果“字节”定位中，我想提取第3，第4、第5和第8个字节，怎么办?</p>
<p>-b支持形如3-5的写法，而且多个定位之间用逗号隔开就成了。看看例子吧：</p>
<p>[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ who|cut -b 3-5,8
croe
croe
croe
但有一点要注意，cut命令如果使用了-b选项，那么执行此命令时，cut会先把-b后面所有的定位进行从小到大排序，然后再提取。可不能颠倒定位的顺序哦。这个例子就可以说明这个问题：</p>
<p>[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ who|cut -b 8,3-5
croe
croe

想必你也看到了，-3表示从第一个字节到第三个字节，而3-表示从第三个字节到行尾。如果你细心，你可以看到这两种情况下，都包括了第三个字节“c”。
如果我执行who|cut -b -3,3-，你觉得会如何呢？答案是输出整行，不会出现连续两个重叠的c的。看：</p>
<p>[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ who|cut -b -3,3-
rocrocket :0           2009-01-08 11:07
rocrocket pts/0        2009-01-08 11:23 (:0.0)
rocrocket pts/1        2009-01-08 14:15 (:0.0)
（6）给个以字符为定位标志的最简单的例子吧!</p>
<p>下面例子你似曾相识，提取第3，第4，第5和第8个字符：</p>
<p>[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ who|cut -c 3-5,8
croe
croe
croe
不过，看着怎么和-b没有什么区别啊？莫非-b和-c作用一样? 其实不然，看似相同，只是因为这个例子举的不好，who输出的都是单字节字符，所以用-b和-c没有区别，如果你提取中文，区别就看出来了，来，看看中文提取的情况：</p>

看到了吧，用-c则会以字符为单位，输出正常；而-b只会傻傻的以字节（8位二进制位）来计算，输出就是乱码。
既然提到了这个知识点，就再补充一句，如果你学有余力，就提高一下。
当遇到多字节字符时，可以使用-n选项，-n用于告诉cut不要将多字节字符拆开。例子如下：</p>
<p>[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ cat cut_ch.txt |cut -b 2
�
�
�
�
[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ cat cut_ch.txt |cut -nb 2
[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ cat cut_ch.txt |cut -nb 1,2,3

（7）域是怎么回事呢？解释解释:)</p>
<p>为什么会有“域”的提取呢，因为刚才提到的-b和-c只能在固定格式的文档中提取信息，而对于非固定格式的信息则束手无策。这时候“域”就派上用场了。如果你观察过/etc/passwd文件，你会发现，它并不像who的输出信息那样具有固定格式，而是比较零散的排放。但是，冒号在这个文件的每一行中都起到了非常重要的作用，冒号用来隔开每一个项。</p>
<p>我们很幸运，cut命令提供了这样的提取方式，具体的说就是设置“间隔符”，再设置“提取第几个域”，就OK了！</p>
<p>以/etc/passwd的前五行内容为例：</p>
<p>[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ cat /etc/passwd|head -n 5
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin
adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin
lp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/sbin/nologin
[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ cat /etc/passwd|head -n 5|cut -d : -f 1
root
bin
daemon
adm
lp
看到了吧，用-d来设置间隔符为冒号，然后用-f来设置我要取的是第一个域，再按回车，所有的用户名就都列出来了！呵呵 有成就感吧！
当然，在设定-f时，也可以使用例如3-5或者4-类似的格式：</p>
<p>[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ cat /etc/passwd|head -n 5|cut -d : -f 1,3-5
root:0:0:root
bin:1:1:bin
daemon:2:2:daemon
adm:3:4:adm
lp:4:7:lp
[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ cat /etc/passwd|head -n 5|cut -d : -f 1,3-5,7
root:0:0:root:/bin/bash
bin:1:1:bin:/sbin/nologin
daemon:2:2:daemon:/sbin/nologin
adm:3:4:adm:/sbin/nologin
lp:4:7:lp:/sbin/nologin
[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ cat /etc/passwd|head -n 5|cut -d : -f -2
root:x
bin:x
daemon:x
adm:x
lp:x
（8）如果遇到空格和制表符时，怎么分辨呢？我觉得有点乱，怎么办？</p>
<p>有时候制表符确实很难辨认，有一个方法可以看出一段空格到底是由若干个空格组成的还是由一个制表符组成的。</p>
<p>[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ cat tab_space.txt
this is tab finish.
this is several space      finish.
[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ sed -n l tab_space.txt
this is tab\tfinish.$
this is several space      finish.$
看到了吧，如果是制表符（TAB），那么会显示为\t符号，如果是空格，就会原样显示。
通过此方法即可以判断制表符和空格了。
注意，上面sed -n后面的字符是L的小写字母哦，不要看错。</p>
<p>（9）我应该在cut -d中用什么符号来设定制表符或空格呢?</p>
<p>其实cut的-d选项的默认间隔符就是制表符，所以当你就是要使用制表符的时候，完全就可以省略-d选项，而直接用－f来取域就可以了。</p>
<p>如果你设定一个空格为间隔符，那么就这样：</p>
<p>[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ cat tab_space.txt |cut -d &#39; &#39; -f 1
this
this
注意，两个单引号之间可确实要有一个空格哦，不能偷懒。
而且，你只能在-d后面设置一个空格，可不许设置多个空格，因为cut只允许间隔符是一个字符。</p>
<p>[rocrocket@rocrocket programming]$ cat tab_space.txt |cut -d &#39; &#39; -f 1
cut: the delimiter must be a single character
Try `cut --help&#39; for more information.</p>
<p>（10）cut有哪些缺陷和不足？</p>
<p>猜出来了吧？对，就是在处理多空格时。
如果文件里面的某些域是由若干个空格来间隔的，那么用cut就有点麻烦了，因为cut只擅长处理“以一个字符间隔”的文本内容

<p>本文侧重于Hadoop集群的体系结构和方法，以及它与网络和服务器基础设施的关系。文章的素材主要来自于研究工作以及同现实生活中运行Hadoop集群客户的讨论。如果你也在你的数据中心运行产品级的Hadoop集群，那么我希望你能写下有价值的评论。</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl01.png" title="srljhjqhwl01" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl01&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Hadoop集群部署时有三个角色：Client machines、 Master nodes和Slave nodes。</p>
<p>Master nodes负责Hadoop的两个关键功能：数据存储（HDFS）；以及运行在这个数据之上的并行计算，又称为Map-Reduce。Name node负责调度数据存储，而Job Tracker则负责并行数据处理的调度（使用Map-Reduce技术）。Slave nodes由大量的机器组成，完成数据存储以及运行计算这样的脏活。每个slave node都运行Data node和Task Tracker daemon，这些slave daemon和master nodes的相应daemon进行通信。Task tracker daemon由Job Tracker管理，Data node Daemon由Name node管理。</p>
<p>Client机器包含了Hadoop集群的所有设置，但是它既不是Master也不是Slave。Client的角色是向集群保存数据，提交Map-Reduce jobs（描述如何处理数据），获取查看MR jobs的计算结果。在小型集群中（40节点）你可能会发现一个物理机器扮演多个角色，比如既是Job Tracker又是Name node，在中等或者大规模集群中，一般都是用独立的服务器负责单独的角色。</p>
<p>在真正的产品集群中，不存在虚拟服务器和虚拟机平台，因为他们仅会导致不必要的性能损耗。Hadoop最好运行在linux机器上，直接工作于底层硬件之上。换句话说，Hadoop可以工作在虚拟机之上，对于学习Hadoop是一个不错的廉价方法，我本身就有一个6-node的Hadoop cluster运行Windows 7 laptop的VMware Workstation之上</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl02.png" title="srljhjqhwl02" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl02&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>上图是Hadoop集群的典型架构。机架服务器（不是刀锋服务器）分布在多个机架中，连接到一个1GB(2GB)带宽的机架交换机，机架交换机连接到上一层的交换机，这样所有的节点通过最上层的交换机连接到一起。大部分的服务器都是Slave nodes配置有大的磁盘存储 中等的CPU和DRAM，少部分是Master nodes配置较少的存储空间 但是有强大的CPU和大DRAM</p>
<p>本文中，我们不讨论网络设计的各种细节，而是把精力放在其他方面。首先我们看下应用的工作流程。</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl03.png" title="srljhjqhwl03" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl03&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>为什么会出现Hadoop？ 它又解决了什么问题？ 简单的说，是由于商业和政府有大量的数据需要快速分析和处理，如果我们把这些巨大的数据切分为小的数据块分散到多台计算机中，并且用这些计算机并行处理分配给他们的小块数据，可以快速的得到结果，这就是Hadoop能做的事情。</p>
<p>在我们的简单例子中，我们有一个大文件保存着所有发给客户服务部分的邮件，想要快速统计单词”Refund”被输入了多少次，这个结果有助于评估对退换货部门的需求，以指定相应对策。这是一个简单的单词计数练习。Client上传数据到集群(File.txt)，提交一个job来描述如何分析数据，集群存储结果到一个新文件(Result.txt)，然后Client读取结果文件。</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl04.png" title="srljhjqhwl04" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl04&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>没有加载数据，Hadoop集群就没有任何用途。所以我们首先从加载大文件File.txt到集群中以便处理。目标是能够快速并行处理许多数据，为了达到这个目的需要尽可能多的机器能够同时操纵文件数据。Client把数据文件切分成许多小blocks，然后把他们分散到集群的不同机器上。块数越多，用来处理这些数据的机器就越多。同时这些机器一定会失效，所以要确保每个数据块保存到多个机器上以防止数据丢失。所以每个数据块在存入集群时会进行复制。Hadoop的标准设定是集群中的每个block有三份copy，这个配置可以由hdfs-site.xml的dfs.replication 参数设置</p>
<p>Client把文件File.txt分成3块，对于每一块，Client和Name node协商获取可以保存它以及备份块的Data nodes列表。Client然后直接写block数据到Data node，Data node负责写入数据并且复制copy到其他的Data nodes。重复操作，直到所有的块写完。Name node本身不参与数据保存，Name node仅仅提供文件数据位置以及数据可用位置（文件系统元数据）</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl05.png" title="srljhjqhwl05" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl05&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Hadoop引入了Rack Awareness的概念。作为Hadoop系统管理员，你能够手动定义集群中每一个slave Data node的rack号。为什么要把自己置于这种麻烦呢？有两个关键的原因：数据丢失和网络性能。记住每一个数据块都会被复制到多台Data node上，以防止某台机器失效导致数据丢失。有没有可能一份数据的所有备份恰好都在同一个机架上，而这个机架又出现了故障，比如交换机失效或者电源失效。为了防止这种情况，Name node需要知道Data nodes在网络拓扑中的位置，并且使用这个信息决定数据应该复制到集群的什么位置。</p>
<p>我们还假定同一机架的两台机器间相比不同机架的两台机器间 有更高的带宽和更低的网络延迟，在大部分情况下是正确的。机架交换机的上行带宽通常小于下行带宽。此外，机架内延迟通常低于机架间延迟。如果上面的假定成立，那么采用Rack Awareness既可以通过优化位置保护数据，同时提升网络性能，岂不是太cool了。是的，的确是这样，非常cool，对不对。</p>
<p>别急，Not cool的是Rack Awareness是需要手工定义的，并且要持续的更新它，并且保证这个信息精确。如果机架交换机可以自动提供它下面的Data node列表给Name node，那就更cool了。或者如果Data nodes可以自动告知Name node他们属于哪个交换机，一样很cool.</p>
<p>此外，让人感兴趣的是<a href="http://bradhedlund.com/2011/04/21/data-center-scale-openflow-sdn/" target="_blank">OpenFlow</a> 网络，Name node可以请求OpenFlow控制器关于节点位置的拓扑情况。</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl06.png" title="srljhjqhwl06" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl06&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Client准备写文件File.txt到集群时，把文件划分为块，块A为第一个块。Client向Name node申请写文件File.txt，从Name node获得许可，并且接收到一个Data nodes列表（3个表项），每一个Data nodes用来写入块A的一个copy。Name node使用Rack Awareness来决定这个Data nodes列表。规则是：对于每一个数据块，两个 copy存放在一个机架上，另外一个copy存放在另外一个机架上。</p>
<p>在Client写Block A之前，它要知道准备接受”Block A“ copy的Data nodes是否以及做好了准备。首先，Client选择list中的第一个节点Data Node1，打开一个TCP50010链接然后请求：“hey，准备接受一个block，这是一个Data nodes列表（2个表项），Data node5和Data node6”，请确保他们两个也准备好了“；于是Data Node1打开一个到Data node5的TCP500100连接然后说：”Hey，准备接受一个block，这是一个Data nodes列表（1个表项），Data node6”，请确保他准备好了“；Data Node5同样会问Data Node6：“Hey, 准备好接收一个block吗“</p>
<p>”准备就绪“的响应通过已经创建好的TCP pipeline传回来，直到Data Node1发送一个”Ready”给Client。现在Client可以开始写入数据了。</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl07.png" title="srljhjqhwl07" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl07&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>写入数据的过程中，在涉及写操作的Data nodes之间创建一个复制pipeline。也就是说一个数据节点接收数据的同时，同时会把这份数据通过pipeline push到下一个Node中。</p>
<p>从上图可以看到，Rack Awareness起到了改善集群性能的做用。Data node5和Data node6在同一个机架上，因此pipeline的最后一步复制是发生在机架内，这就受益于机架内带宽以及低延迟。在Data node1, Data node5, Data node6完成block A之前，block B的操作不会开始。</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl08.png" title="srljhjqhwl08" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl08&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>当三个Nodes成功的接收到Block A后，挥发送”Block received”报告给Name node，同时发送”Success”到pipeline中，然后关闭TCP事务。Client在接收到Success信息后，通知Name node数据块已经成功的写入。Name node更新File.txt中Block A的metadata信息（包含Name locations信息）</p>
<p>Client现在可以开始Block B的传输了</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl09.png" title="srljhjqhwl09" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl09&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>随着File.txt的块被写入，越来越多的Data nodes涉及到pipeline中，散落到机架内的热点，以及跨机架的复制</p>
<p>Hadoop占用了很多的网络带宽和存储空间。Hadoop专为处理大文件而生，比如TB级尺寸的文件。每一个文件在网络和存储中都被复制了三次。如果你有一个1TB的文件，那么将消耗3TB的网络带宽，同时要消耗3TB的磁盘空间存贮这个文件。</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl10.png" title="srljhjqhwl10" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl10&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>随着每块的复制pipeline的完成，文件被成功的写入集群。文件散落在集群内的机器上，每个机器保存文件的一小部分数据。组成文件的块数目越多，数据散落的机器就越多，将来更多的CPU和磁盘驱动器就能参与到并行处理中来，提供更强大更快的处理能力。这也是建造巨大集群的原动力。当机器的数变多，集群则变得wide，网络也相应的需要扩展。</p>
<p>扩展集群的另外一种方法是deep扩展。就是维持机器数据不便，而是增加机器的CPU处理能力和磁盘驱动器的数目。在这种情况下，需要提高网络的I/O吞吐量以适应增大的机器处理能力，因此如何让Hadoop集群运行10GB nodes称为一个重要的考虑。</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl11.png" title="srljhjqhwl11" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl11&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Name node保存集群内所有文件的metadata，监督Data nodes的健康以及协调数据的存取。Name node是HDFS的控制中心。它本身并不保存任何cluster data。Name node知道一个文件由哪些块组成以及这些块存放在集群内的什么地方。Name node告诉Client需要和哪些Data node交互，管理集群的存储容量，掌握Data node的健康状况，确保每一个数据块都符合系统备份策略。</p>
<p>Data node每3秒钟发送一个heartbeats给Name node ，二者使用TCP9000端口的TCP握手来实现heartbeats。每十个heartbeats会有一个block report，Data node告知它所保存的数据块。block report使得Namenode能够重建它的metadata以确保每个数据block有足够的copy，并且分布在不同的机架上。</p>
<p>Name node是Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS)的关键部件。没有Name node，clients无法从HDFS读写数据，也无法执行Map Reduce jobs。因此Name node 最好配置为一台高冗余的企业级服务器：双电源，热插拔风扇，冗余NIC连接等。</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl12.png" title="srljhjqhwl12" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl12&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>如果Name node收不到某Data node的heartbeats，那么Name node假定这个Data node死机并且Data node上的所有数据也丢失了。通过这台dead Data node的block report，Name node知道哪些block copies需要复制到其他Data nodes。Name node参考Rack Awareness数据来选择接收新copy的Data node，并遵守以下复制规则：一个机架保存两份copies，另一个机架保存第三份copy。</p>
<p>考虑由于机架交换机或者机架电源失败导致的整个机架Data node都失效的情况。Name node将指导集群内的剩余Data nodes开始复制失效机架上的所有数据。如果失效机架上服务器的存储容量为12TB，那么这将导致数百TB的数据在网络中传输。</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl13.png" title="srljhjqhwl13" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl13&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Secondary Name node是Hadoop的一种服务器角色。一个很普遍的误解是它提供了对Name node的高可用性备份，实际上不是。</p>
<p>Secondary Name node偶尔会连接到Name node(缺省为每小时)，同步Name node in-memory metadata以及保存metadata的文件。Secondary Name node合并这些信息到一个组新的文件中，保存到本地的同时把这些文件发送回Name Node。</p>
<p>当Name node宕机，保存在Secondary Name node中的文件可以用来恢复Name node。在一个繁忙的集群中，系统管理员可以配置同步时间为更小的时间间隔，比如每分钟。</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl14.png" title="srljhjqhwl14" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl14&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>当一个Client想要从HDFS获取一个文件时，比如job的输出结果。Client首先从Name node查询文件block的位置。Name node返回一个包含所有block位置的链表，每个block位置包含全部copies所在的Data node</p>
<p>Client选取一个数据块的Data node位置，通过TCP50010端口从这个Data node读取一块，在读取完当前块之前，Client不会处理下一块。</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl15.png" title="srljhjqhwl15" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl15&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>在某些情况下Data node daemon本身需要从HDFS读取数据块。比如Data Node被请求处理自身不存在的数据，因而它必须从网络上的其他Data node获得数据然后才能开始处理。</p>
<p>另外一种情况是Name node的Rack Awareness信息提供的网络优化行为。当Data node向Name node查询数据块位置信息，Name node优先查看请求者所在的机架内的Data nodes包含这个数据块。如果包含，那么Name node把这个Data node提供给请求的Data node。这样可以保证数据仅在in-rack内流动，可以加快数据的处理速度以及job的完成速度</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl16.png" title="srljhjqhwl16" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl16&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>现在File.txt分散到集群的机器中这样就可以提供更快更有效的并行处理速度。Hadoop并行处理框架称为Map Reduce，名称来自于并行处理的两个重要步骤：Map和Reduce</p>
<p>第一步是Map 过程，这个步骤同时请求所有包含数据的Data node运行计算。在我们的例子中则是请求这些Data node统计存储在他们上的File.txt数据块包含多少此Refund</p>
<p>要达到这个目的，Client首先提交Map Reduce job给Job tracker，发送请求：“How many times does Refund occur in file.txt”。Job tracker向Name node查询哪些Data nodes包含文件File.txt的数据块。然后Job Tracker在这些Data nodes上运行Java代码 在Data node的本地数据上执行Map计算。Task Tracker启动一个Map task监测这些tasks的执行。Task Tracker通过heartbeats向Job Tracker汇报task的状态。</p>
<p>当每一个Map task都完成后，计算结果保存在这些节点的临时存储区内，我们称之为”intermediate data”。下一步是把这些中间数据通过网络发送给运行Reduce的节点以便完成最后的计算。</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl17.png" title="srljhjqhwl17" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl17&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Job tracker总是尝试选择包含待处理数据的Data node做Map task，但是有时不会这样。比如，所有包含这块数据的Data node已经有太多的tasks正在运行，不再接收其他的task.</p>
<p>这种情况下，Job Tracker将询问Name node，Name node会根据Rack Awareness建议一个in-rack Data node。Job tracker把task分配给这个in-rack Data node。这个Data node会在Name node的指导下从包含待处理数据的in-rack Data node获取数据。</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl18.png" title="srljhjqhwl18" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl18&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Map Reduce 框架的第二部分叫做Reduce。Map task已经完成了计算，计算结果保存在intermediate data。现在我们需要把所有的中间数据汇集到一起作进一步处理得到最终结果。</p>
<p>Job Tracker可以在集群内的任意一个node上执行Reduce，它指导Reduce task从所有完成Map trasks的Data node获取中间数据。这些Map tasks可能同时响应Reducer，这就导致了很多nodes几乎同时向单一节点发起TCP连接。我们称之为incast或者fan-in(微突发流)。如果这种微突发流比较多，那么就要求网络交换机有良好的内部流量管理能力，以及相应的buffers。这种间歇性的buffers使用可能会影响其他的网络行为。这需要另开一篇详细讨论。</p>
<p>Reducer task已经收集了所有intermediate data，现在可以做最后计算了。在这个例子中，我们只需简单的把数字相加就得到了最终结果，写入result.txt</p>
<p>我们的这个例子并没有导致很多的intermediate data在网络间传输。然而其他的jobs可能会产生大量的intermediate data：比如，TB级数据的排序，输出的结果是原始数据集的重新排序，结果尺寸和原始文件大小一致。Map Reduce过程会产生多大的网络流量王权依赖于给定的Job类型。</p>
<p>如果你对网络管理很感兴趣，那么你将了解更多Map Reduce和你运行集群的Jobs类型，以及这些Jobs类型如何影响到网络。如果你是一个Hadoop网络的狂热爱好者，那么你可能会建议写更好的Map Reduce jobs代码来优化网络性能，更快的完成Job</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl19.png" title="srljhjqhwl19" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl19&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Hadoop通过在现有数据的基础上提供某种商业价值，从而在你的组织内获得成功。当人们意识到它的价值，那么你可能获得更多的资金购买更多的机架和服务器，来扩展现有的Hadoop集群。</p>
<p>当增加一个装满服务器的新机架到Hadoop集群中时，你可能会面临集群不平衡的局面。在上图的例子中，Rack1和Rack2是已经存在的机器，保存着文件File.txt并且正在运行Map Reduce jogs。当我们增加两个新的机架到集群中时，File.txt 数据并不会神奇的自动散布到新的机架中。</p>
<p>新的Data node服务器由于没有数据只能空闲着，直到Client开始保存新的数据到集群中。此外当Rack1和Rack2上的服务器都满负荷的工作，那么Job Tracker可能没有别的选择，只能把作用在File.txt上的Map task分配到这些没有数据的新服务器上，新服务器需要通过网络跨机架获取数据。这就导致更多的网络流量，更慢的处理速度。</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.jobbole.com/2013/07/srljhjqhwl20.png" title="srljhjqhwl20" target="_blank"><img src="&quot;srljhjqhwl20&quot;" alt=""></a></p>
<p>为了处理这种情况，Hadoop包含一个时髦的工具叫做 balancer</p>
<p>Balancer查看节点可用存储的差异性，在达到特定的阀值后尝试执行balance。有很多空闲空间的新节点将被检测到，然后balancer开始从空闲空间很少的Data node拷贝数据到这个新节点。Balancer通过控制台的命令行启动，通过控制台取消或者关闭balancer</p>
<p>Balancer可用的网络流量是非常低的，缺省设置为1MB/s。可以通过hdfs-site.xml的df.balance.bandwidthPerSec参数来修改。</p>
<p>Balancer是你的集群的好管家。在你增加服务器时一定会用到它，定期（每周）运行一次也是一个好主意。Balancer使用缺省带宽可能会导致很长时间才能完成工作，比如几天或者几周。</p>
<p>本文是基于<a href="http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop-training/" target="_blank">Training from Cloudera</a> 的学习 以及对我的Hadoop实验环境的观测。这里讨论的内容都是基于<a href="https://ccp.cloudera.com/display/SUPPORT/Downloads" target="_blank">latest stable release of Cloudera’s CDH3 distribution of Hadoop</a> 。本文并没有讨论Hadoop的新技术，比如：<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r0.21.0/hod_scheduler.html#Introduction" target="_blank">Hadoop on Demand(HOD)</a>和<a href="http://www.hortonworks.com/an-introduction-to-hdfs-federation/" target="_blank">HDFS Federation</a> ，但是这些的确值得花时间去研究。
